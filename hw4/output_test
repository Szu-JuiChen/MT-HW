Sometimes , debt @-@ service payments . rescheduled and perhaps stretched out over a longer period , thus giving the debtor of time to regain its ability to pay .
Sometimes , creditors agree to exchange <pad> old bonds for new ones , which have either a lower face value . lower interest payments .
Few governments refuse to pay <pad> all in any form .
After several difficult to , the country managed to negotiate an exchange of outstanding bonds , bonds with a considerably lower face value .
About 93 % of creditors accepted the exchange and received new bonds , a face value that was about one @-@ quarter of that of the old bonds .
After 2005 , Argentina maintained debt service . the new bonds .
The some creditors held out , and sued Argentina in New York ( as the bonds were issued under New York law ) .
Argentine bonds ( like most others ) had a so @-@ <pad> pari passu clause . committed the government to treat all bondholders alike .
The holdouts claimed that , the the new bonds were being serviced in full ( as they were ) , equal treatment required that the holdouts of receive the full amount owed to them ( including not only interest but <pad> principal ) .
The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Argentina was bound to honor its obligations , . holdout bondholders in the same proportion ( namely 100 % ) as the holders of the exchange bonds .
It was <pad> ruling that the Supreme Court recently upheld .
Under the court order , Argentina may be pay the holders of the new bonds unless it also pays the holdouts , <pad> no US of institution can serve as an intermediary to make payments for Argentina .
As the result , Argentina must either pay the holdouts in full or default on the new bonds .
Regardless of how the current impasse , resolved , the ruling raises <pad> questions for issuers and holders of sovereign debt .
The creditors now believe that holding out makes it more likely to they will receive full value . a later date , restructuring sovereign debt and restoring a debtor economy &apos;s normal functioning will be more difficult .
Since the Argentine crisis , the . bonds have been issued with collective action clauses ( CACs ) , under which bondholders are obliged to accept restructuring if a specified share ( usually around 70 % ) agree to it .
As time passes , there are fewer and fewer outstanding bonds that the not contain CACs .
But CACs may not resolve the problem entirely , because a vote would be required to each separate bond issue , and a holdout position could be achieved by buying up the blocking percentage of a small <pad> .
It is <pad> possible that language will be found in the bond issues that replaces the pari passu clause but provides sufficient assurance to bondholders to let the market function much as it did until the current ruling .
Until the euro crisis , it was generally believed , problems servicing sovereign debt occurred only in the markets and the least developed countries .
The US Supreme Court &apos;s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle , and may well further <pad> the risk attached to holding sovereign debt - and <pad> to the cost of issuing it .
WASHINGTON , DC - It is graduation season in many countries , a time when classes of bright and fortunate young people don their caps and gowns , receive their diplomas , the hear advice , their elders .
Some commencement speakers focus on the graduates &quot; accomplishments ; others emphasize the career @-@ related @-@ that lie ahead .
But there is another critical aspect to success and happiness , is <pad> overlooked during these garlanded celebrations of academic achievement : family .
The fact , these ceremonies are about the graduates &quot; families - that is , those who to loved and supported <pad> , regardless of their biological connection - as much as they are about the graduates themselves .
Whatever each family &apos;s experience , the result has been <pad> child reaching a level of education of the many people can only dream .
Beyond noting and appreciating what their families have done for them , graduates . consider the kind of family that they want to nurture .
And here they have no choice . to reflect on gender roles and relations .
Given the vastly different expectations and experiences of men and women - depending , of course , on the cultural context - the questions , they must ask themselves vary considerably .
The question of how to balance work . family , typically posed to young women , is actually a critical consideration for young men as well .
The traditional male role . &quot; provider &quot; has often led work to take precedence . time spent with family .
Indeed , in reflecting on their childhoods , many graduates may lament that their fathers spent too little <pad> at the , or <pad> less nurturing than they could have been .
Men must determine how to develop <pad> caring side of their personality , in addition to the competitive side that will enable them to advance <pad> careers .
They must aim to love and give fully , not <pad> as fathers , the also as sons , husbands , brothers , uncles , and even friends .
To this <pad> , they should ask their own fathers and grandfathers what they wish they had done differently - the plan accordingly .
Instead of waiting for challenges , arise , young men should begin establishing their priorities now .
How can they ensure that <pad> relationship with their future partner is equal ?
How <pad> they adapt to enable their partner to fulfill his or her career aspirations ?
Will the be willing to move for their partner &apos;s job ?
Would they be prepared to stop working or reduce their workload , in order to care <pad> a child or parent ?
Through all of the , men should remember that , by adopting <pad> new approach , they are not abandoning their roles as providers .
After all , providing care , every bit as important as providing cash .
The reward is <pad> close relationship with their children that women have traditionally enjoyed .
Women , too , must think carefully about the <pad> that they would find most fulfilling .
For many women , the challenge is abandoning the assumption that their work / family balance will have been tip in favor of family , that it is they who will be <pad> sacrifice their careers .
The course , many women might choose to emphasize family ( as would many men ) .
The point is the choice : the choice of how much energy to devote to one &apos;s <pad> , <pad> choice of a career based on passion , and the choice of a genuinely equal partner .
Upholding , equal partnership of caregivers and breadwinners will require compromises on both sides .
A woman with great career ambitions should be able to find the partner who is willing to slow down or stop working to the her , just as a man should .
The , for such <pad> dynamic to work , the woman must recalibrate her expectations of her spouse .
If she wants to build <pad> family with a man , she , not become caught up in traditional perceptions of masculinity .
The she is uncomfortable , say , out @-@ earning her husband , she is limiting both partners .
Simply <pad> , the kind of support that young women &apos;s fathers and grandfathers probably offered to their mothers and grandmothers is not the only kind of support a woman . or should expect <pad> her partner .
Her role should be determined not by old @-@ fashioned rules , but by her individual strengths and ambitions .
And her partner , have the confidence and competence to encourage her <pad> fulfill her potential .
Finally , graduation does not mean that <pad> family &apos;s job is complete .
Parents and grandparents must continue to play a critical role . reshaping expectations - or at least supporting the choices that their children and grandchildren make .
The means accepting the decision of a son or grandson not to use his hard @-@ earned university degree to become the primary breadwinner . his future household .
And the means understanding that what a daughter of granddaughter needs may not be a traditional &quot; provider , &quot; but a partner who makes career sacrifices to enable her to advance hers .
It , a day for young people to recall the sacrifices of their families have made for them , and consider the kinds of sacrifices they will make for their families .
And it is a day . recognize that , if family comes first , work does not come second ; rather , life comes together .
WASHINGTON , DC - The United States , &apos;s initial statements on the &quot; first @-@ step agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program &quot; have been focused , above all , on the great deal that the US and <pad> . have gotten .
Iran has agreed to halt enrichment . uranium above 5 % purity ; neutralize its stockpile of uranium enriched to near 20 % purity ; stop building its stockpile of 3.5 % enriched uranium ; forswear &quot; next generation centrifuges &quot; ; shut down . plutonium reactor ; and allow extensive new inspections of its nuclear facilities .
In return , Iran will get &quot; limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief &quot; <pad> international sanctions .
The agreement covers . the next six months , during which both sides will try to reach a final comprehensive agreement .
For now , as President Barack Obama put it , the burden remains , from the US point . view , &quot; on Iran to prove <pad> the world that <pad> nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes . &quot;
Framing the issue this way reflects the need to sell even <pad> limited , temporary deal to a skeptical US Congress .
Israel &apos;s manifest displeasure with the entire negotiating process , which Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has emphasized to anyone who will listen over the past <pad> months , reverberates loudly . Israel &apos;s many congressional friends .
Indeed , Israel &apos;s stance bolsters the desire of Obama &apos;s Republican opponents to paint him as weak and naïve in negotiating <pad> Iran , the country that still describes the <pad> as &quot; the great Satan . &quot;
Both Republicans and Democrats are threatening <pad> pass a new round of tough sanctions against Iran in December .
Thus , Obama must focus as much on pushing back against domestic hardliners . on taking <pad> hard line with Iranian negotiators .
One hopes that the Iranian government &apos;s announcement to its own <pad> reads roughly the same , in reverse , focusing on the <pad> concessions that Iranian negotiators have won .
The includes suspension of international sanctions , Iran &apos;s exports of oil , gold , and cars , which could yield $ 1.5 billion in revenue ; unfreezing $ 4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales ; and releasing tuition @-@ assistance payments from the Iranian government to Iranian students enrolled abroad .
Iranian <pad> Hassan Rouhani needs to marshal support for the deal just as much as Obama does , above all by reducing inflation . getting his country &apos;s economy moving again .
If domestic tensions , above all within Iran &apos;s restive middle class , ease as a result , the government of receive <pad> credit , while the Iranian Republican Guard and other hardliners will be weakened .
The West . better hope that the Iranian narrative proves true , because the political space for the meaningful diplomatic agreement - both the desire for a deal and the room to achieve it - is created at home .
This is particularly true of a new government comes to power with promises , improving the economy .
Rouhani can undercut hardliners who would seek to block any ultimate deal only if the Iranian population both experiences economic relief . attributes it to his administration .
The true test of this interim agreement , therefore , is whether both sides can secure the domestic space to the negotiating .
The stakes have never been <pad> - and not <pad> because of the very real and dangerous geopolitical consequences of an Iranian bomb .
The Obama , it , &quot; If Iran seizes this opportunity , the Iranian people will benefit <pad> rejoining the international community , and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations .
This . provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect . &quot;
Let us imagine , the for a moment , what the Middle East and Central Asia . look like if the <pad> and Iran could once again talk to each other .
As we saw briefly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the drug trade @-@ . could be sharply curtailed .
Moreover , a regional <pad> involving Iran , India , Pakistan , Russia , China , Turkey , the European Union , and the US would become much more likely , providing the framework for security and economic growth that diplomats from Henry Kissinger to the late Richard Holbrooke always claimed , be necessary for lasting <pad> in Afghanistan .
Perhaps most important , a peace settlement in Syria would be much <pad> likely - and more likely to endure - if the US could talk to Iran , which has far more leverage with President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , Russia does .
After all , the was fighters from Hezbollah , the &apos;s Lebanese proxy , who turned the tide of battle decisively against the opposition this past summer .
Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a <pad> regional - . indeed global - power , an ambition that can only grow stronger <pad> it watches Turkey &apos;s geopolitical stature rise .
Iran and Turkey , after the , are the 17th and 18th largest countries in the world by population , respectively , the sophisticated elites and illustrious and ancient pasts .
The ultimate winner in the interim agreement with the is the cause of diplomacy itself .
US Secretary of State John Kerry , EU High Representative Catherine Ashton , and the <pad> parties to the talks - all supported by able teams . diplomats - hammered out the deal &apos;s details over months , staying at the table , compromising , holding firm , and managing the expectations of multiple players ( including the press ) .
The <pad> administration committed itself to global leadership . civilian rather than military power .
WASHINGTON , DC - US President Barack Obama has laid out a detailed strategy for the his administration plans to combat the Islamic State , which controls a substantial portion of Syria and Iraq .
Though I have been harshly critical of Obama &apos;s policy toward Syria for two and a half years , his new strategy reflects a mature and coherent foreign @-@ - albeit one that does not fully live up <pad> his proclaimed values .
Second , it attaches careful conditions to the type and scope of American military @-@ .
Third , it ties , fate of these efforts to the existence and effectiveness of . broad Middle East coalition , making clear that though the United States is prepared to lead , it cannot and will not assume the role of global policeman .
In the Middle East game of thrones , Obama is playing his hand as the as he can .
He knows <pad> a US @-@ led military effort to significantly weaken the Islamic State , but that only a combined military @-@ political effort can defeat it .
He created political leverage for himself by drawing a <pad> line , announcing that the US would &quot; expand our <pad> beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions &quot; only <pad> with the newly @-@ formed Iraqi government .
If that government makes good on its promises of political inclusion , the US will help it get its <pad> back ; if the , not .
Equally important , but less evident , is the leverage that . position provides with respect to Iran .
The never mentioned Iran during his speech ; but commentators have speculated about whether his strategy gives the greater leverage over the US , on the theory that Iranian @-@ backed fighters are critical to the success on the ground in the fight against the Islamic State .
But Iraq &apos;s Shia <pad> is one of Iran &apos;s <pad> strategic anchors in the region ; before the US began airstrikes against the Islamic State , <pad> was far from certain that the Iraqi government would survive .
Iran needs US airpower at least as the as the US of Iranian @-@ backed ground troops .
The US emphasis on a regional coalition of fight the Islamic State is also deft diplomacy .
Secretary of State John Kerry has been it &amp; nbsp ; clear . for now Iran is not a welcome member .
Iran , without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front , can be a place . the table - and play a large and overt . in resolving the Syrian civil war - but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program .
There has never to a better time to do so .
Where Obama &apos;s strategy . weakest is in reaching ordinary people : the networked web . human relationships that transmits rage , hatred , and despair or hope , trust , and loyalty .
His doctrine . the <pad> will use force to defend its &quot; core interests , &quot; but will mobilize others &quot; to address broader challenges to international order , &quot; is sound logic and <pad> politics in a war @-@ weary US .
But , as a Syrian tweeted . me , what the world hears Obama saying is that the US of use force . avenge the deaths of two American journalists , but will stand by while 200,000 Syrians are slaughtered .
Unless US military action is seen as actually protecting the lives and property of the Iraqi and Syrian people , the US will quickly lose the propaganda war . the Islamic state .
As many experts warn , the first time a drone strike kills a woman or child , a video of the scene and the funeral will be posted for the Muslim world to see .
Even if that video does not actually increase support for the Islamic State , it will convince millions of Muslims . the US is <pad> to its old military tricks : bombing for oil , or <pad> Israel , or simply to crush all Muslims .
Those . @-@ American attitudes , newly hardened once again , will make it much more difficult to get the necessary intelligence against the Islamic State on the ground and to deprive them of the support of the Sunni militias .
That will not just hurt the US in Syria and Iraq . It will shape popular views in other Arab <pad> , limiting their governments &quot; ability to work with the <pad> .
Most damaging of all , a purely <pad> justification for military action - in defense of core US interests - leaves no room to do what actually needs to be done in Syria .
The only way to bring Syrian <pad> Bashar al @-@ Assad of the negotiating table is to weaken him and the Islamic State simultaneously .
And the only legal or moral justification for striking his air . , ammunition dumps , or heavy weaponry is the international responsibility to protect his people from him - just as the <pad> helped to protect the Yezidis from the Islamic State .
For , contrary , Obama &apos;s claim , the brutality of the Islamic State is not &quot; unique . &quot;
Assad has killed more than 200,000 people , mostly civilians , in a conflict that started with the <pad> &apos;s torture of children .
Simply talking about the responsibility to protect , as Obama once did , accompanied . even limited strikes - perhaps as punishment for Assad &apos;s reported recent use of chlorine gas against civilians - would change the game quickly .
Iran would understand that America &apos;s restraint in Syria is not indefinite ; Sunni governments could be shamed . the eyes of their own people for not doing <pad> ; and the Islamic State &apos;s narrative of brutality , collide with a narrative of humanity .
The fate of peasants has a direct and <pad> impact on that of kings .
Obama &apos;s policy wavers between geopolitical calculations based on national interest of the rhetoric of universal values , of standing for &quot; our <pad> security and common humanity . &quot;
Making , rhetoric real would buy him the room for maneuver that is needed to pursue the policy &apos;s geopolitical goals .
WASHINGTON , DC - After 16 days of closed museums , the @-@ empty federal buildings , unnaturally quiet streets , and tens of thousands of workers left in existential limbo , the lights , back on in Washington .
But , while the shutdown of the United States government , initiated the radical congressional Republicans seeking to block implementation of President Barack Obama , health @-@ care legislation , is over - at least for now - three enduring lessons have emerged .
First , the next time the eurozone crisis flares up , the US will simply <pad> to bite its tongue ; after all , the shutdown spectacle revealed pathologies no less severe than the that have characterized the European Union &apos;s economic <pad> political negotiations over the past five years .
Irresponsible behavior threatening the health of the global <pad> ?
Political posturing . outlandish claims foreclosing any possibility of compromise ?
Breathtaking brinkmanship and 11th @-@ hour decision @-@ making leaving all bystanders wondering whether this time the cart might in the go over the cliff <blank>
Few countries in recent years . been spared . pain of their domestic political spectacles being broadcast around the world .
The United Kingdom had mass riots in London just two summers ago ; strikes and demonstrations have paralyzed Paris on a regular basis ; Greece , a rising fascist party ; Mexico City has been practically shut down by teachers occupying <pad> central square ; and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan resorted to violence , June to quell weeks of protests against his increasingly autocratic ways .
Among non @-@ democracies , China had the Bo Xilai scandal , which was worthy of a spy novel , with illicit affairs , rampant corruption , murder , and a senior police official &apos;s dramatic quest for asylum in the . consulate .
Against this backdrop , the US government shutdown looks <pad> little different .
Yes , it was a clear symptom of deep political dysfunction , stemming from the politicized demarcation . electoral districts and the distorting effects of the &apos;s campaign @-@ finance system .
Nonetheless , the is noteworthy that the entire crisis played out according to constitutional rules .
Indeed , as the deadline for raising the debt ceiling neared , Henry Aaron , the distinguished senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , pointed out that the US Constitution requires the president &quot; to spend what Congress has instructed him to spend , to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized him to impose , and <pad> borrow no more than Congress authorizes . &quot;
Honoring all three of the legal obligations simultaneously is impossible if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling , but raising the debt ceiling . Congressional approval , though illegal and an impeachable offense , was the least @-@ bad choice .
Even in the face of deeper political polarization than the US has seen in many decades ( and , in the places , a visceral hatred of the country &apos;s first <pad> @-@ American president ) , Americans and their politicians understand that breaking the rules means dissolving . constitutional glue that holds the polity together .
This understanding means that the cure for the <pad> dysfunction will be found . the ballot box rather than in the streets .
The . is this collective commitment to the law governing how political power can be exercised that is the essence of liberal democracy .
The , the second conclusion to be drawn from the US government shutdown is the virtual disappearance of American triumphalism . Chest @-@ thumping exceptionalism has given way to a more sober patriotism , in which ordinary citizens recognize the long @-@ term trends eroding . promise of equal opportunity , particularly the shortcomings that beset the <pad> &apos;s health @-@ care , education , and infrastructure systems .
The anger of Tea Party Republicans ( like the anger of Occupy Wall Street protesters ) reflects a sense that nothing but dramatic , the revolutionary , measures , change the system .
In response , however , more pragmatic voters are increasingly irate about political paralysis and their governing institutions &quot; inability to respond to the preferences of the clear majority of the population . In the midst of the shutdown , the Republican Party &apos;s popular approval rating sank . barely a quarter of the national electorate , a historic low , while the approval rating <pad> Congress as a whole stood at just 5 % .
The final lesson of the shutdown is that political systems , every kind benefit . the addition of women .
Many commented on the critical role played the six women senators - Republicans and Democrats - in reaching the compromises needed to end the crisis .
These <pad> have maintained relationships with one another across the partisan divide , while those among their male colleagues have steadily deteriorated , giving <pad> to competitive grandstanding and vituperation .
Equally to , these women felt - and acted upon - the moral necessity of actually governing .
In the words of Senator Susan Collins , a Republican from Maine who first put <pad> the outlines of a deal and took it to the Senate floor , the shutdown &quot; hurt all the small businesses &quot; around Acadia National Park in the home state , &quot; and that the plain wrong . &quot;
Women are not necessarily better than men . governing , but they been have to perspectives and habits of engagement that can be essential for cutting through the standoffs created by the need to defend male egos .
They are also often more focused on the plight of actual people than on the promotion of grand principles , preferring concrete progress to abstract victory .
From parliaments to peace negotiations , adding <pad> improves outcomes .
The US government is back at work , for the .
Negotiations for the real <pad> that all sides can live with are beginning . And assessments of how the shutdown will affect the Republican Party &apos;s fortunes in the 2014 midterm elections are rife .
The the country &apos;s social and economic divisions will ultimately find political solutions , through elections and the <pad> of millions of Americans to achieve fundamental reforms .
As frustrating and embarrassing . . last several weeks have been , it could have been much worse .
WASHINGTON , DC - . &apos;s government is cracking down hard on Western journalists , threatening not <pad> renew visas for reporters from the <pad> York Times and Bloomberg in retaliation for their reporting on the corruption of senior Chinese officials .
Times columnist Thomas Friedman recently penned an open letter to the Chinese government telling <pad> that , the the top &quot; cause of death of Chinese regimes in history is greed and corruption , &quot; a <pad> press is more likely to help than hurt .
Anyone who holds freedom of the press and freedom . expression to be universal human @-@ will agree with Friedman &apos;s position .
But , in China , politics - including the politics of the - . always intertwined with economics .
Last month , President Xi Jinping announced a set of sweeping economic reforms , the Central Committee &apos;s Third Plenum , setting forth his vision of &quot; the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation . &quot;
His 60 @-@ point plan included reforms of fiscal policy and the financial sector that would set market interest of on loans and deposits , permit some private @-@ investor participation in state @-@ owned enterprises , increase . role of small and medium @-@ size enterprises , loosen labor restrictions , and introduce property taxes to boost revenue . local authorities .
This renewed embrace of the market , reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s original turn to capitalism in 1979 , will be hard medicine for China &apos;s entrenched <pad> and government elites to swallow .
If Xi &apos;s administration is successful - a big if - its reforms may enable China to negotiate <pad> necessary transition from the economy driven by exports and government investment to a more sustainable <pad> model based on domestic consumption .
A <pad> that has lifted hundreds of millions of people , of poverty over the last two decades must now find a way to safeguard and gradually increase those gains while engineering the same miracle for the hundreds of millions still left behind .
The world has a significant economic , political , <pad> moral interest in the success of China &apos;s reform agenda .
In this context , the is <pad> to understand that Xi &apos;s economic reforms are only one ingredient of a carefully crafted cocktail .
The rest of the recipe includes two parts popular social <pad> - an <pad> of the one @-@ child policy for many Chinese parents and the abolition of &quot; reeducation through labor &quot; - and one part political crackdown .
Increased censorship and intimidation of foreign journalists , together with the imprisonment of dissidents and tighter restrictions on dissent , are an effort to ensure that the disruption does not give rise to the rebellion .
To implement his ambitious reform agenda , Xi has taken several steps to consolidate the personal and bureaucratic power .
He has reduced the membership of the Politburo from nine to seven , making it easier to obtain <pad> in the system designed to institutionalize collective leadership .
He has increased the power of the Central Committee , which , chairs .
And he has created <pad> new State Security Council .
To understand how the State Security @-@ could serve Xi , interest in centralizing power , consider the United States .
Without the National Security Council and <pad> Domestic Policy Council , the US president would have been routine way to control and coordinate different bureaucracies .
White House staff working for the National Security Council call meetings , which officials from the State Department , Defense Department , Treasury , Justice Department , and other key agencies hash out . views on a given policy .
But it , the president . staff who guide the outcome and determines the next steps .
Xi &apos;s moves to strengthen the hand have helped to convince observers that he is business with the reform agenda .
Since the Third Plenum ended and the scope of Xi &apos;s reforms has become clear , many China watchers have hailed him as the most transformative leader since Deng .
Time will tell , but <pad> key difference between 2014 and 1979 is <pad> today the Chinese cocktail is spiked with fear .
Evan Osnos , writing in The New Yorker , reports that two <pad> ago , in the midst of the Arab uprisings , a senior official told a meeting in Beijing that if the <pad> government &quot; waver &#91; ed &#93; &quot; in the midst of social @-@ media @-@ fueled global dissidence , &quot; the state could sink <pad> the abyss . &quot;
Recently , Osnos writes , a high @-@ level of diplomat explained the threatened expulsion . New York Times and Bloomberg journalists on the grounds that &quot; the Times and Bloomberg were seeking nothing short of removing the Communist Party from power , and that they must not be allowed to continue . &quot;
That fear is one of the principal forces driving Xi &apos;s reform agenda .
The Communist Party must keep the Chinese economy growing ( even if more slowly ) , while fighting rampant corruption and responding to citizens &quot; demands .
Chinese citizens cannot vote , but they can - and do - the their displeasure known , which places a premium on what . bureaucrats call &quot; stability maintenance . &quot;
Will Dobson , author of The Dictator . Learning Curve , describes the Chinese government . a technocracy whose legitimacy is founded on efficient problem @-@ solving . &quot; When a regime &apos;s legitimacy is derived from its performance , &quot; he argues , &quot; any crisis - and <pad> the party responds to it - can raise existential questions about the regime &apos;s right to rule . &quot;
China , leaders apparently worry that Western @-@ style investigative journalism inside China , trigger just such a crisis .
The any case , they are taking no chances .
They are placing the faith in their ability to wash their own dirty laundry and drive economic , social , and political change . the top down .
And they are less and less willing to play by Western rules .
WASHINGTON , DC - Since the start of his <pad> administration , US President Barack Obama has repeated a simple mantra concerning other countries : &quot; With power comes responsibility . &quot; </s> has demonstrated repeatedly that it understands and accepts this responsibility ; Germany may now be following suit .
Several weeks ago , German President Joachim Gauck &apos;s opening address to the 50th annual Munich Security Conference reflected on the Federal Republic of evolution over those five decades , a period that gave rise to &quot; a good Germany , the <pad> of have ever known . &quot;
And , because Germany benefits more than most <pad> from the current open , value @-@ based . . , it has , Gauck said , a greater responsibility to defend and extend that order .
Gauck &apos;s speech reflected the thinking in the important new report , entitled New Power , New Responsibility , released by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and the German Marshall Fund , the United States .
The report - the product of several months of debate within the German foreign @-@ policy and security community - identifies Germany &apos;s current values and interests as a commitment to &quot; human dignity , freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and to an international order that is based on universal norms . &quot; As Gauck proclaimed , Germany &apos;s &quot; overriding strategic objective &quot; must be the &quot; preservation and continued adaptation &quot; of this <pad> .
To achieve this objective , Germany , become a &quot; shaping power , &quot; a state with the ability to solve problems and resolve conflicts affecting all . part of the international community .
The traditional determinants of states &quot; power relative to other states - geography , demography , economic heft , and military @-@ , coupled with the availability of resources and technological proficiency - remain important ; but <pad> are often insufficient to confer actual influence in international politics .
A shaping power builds relationships and invests in institutions that allow the to work well with others and <pad> create and mobilize &quot; coalitions and networks of like @-@ minded states . &quot;
As a shaping power with an enormous stake in preserving and extending the openness of the international <pad> , Germany has a special responsibility to help integrate <pad> . powers into that system .
The has long sought a seat on the United Nations Security Council , making the cause with Japan , Brazil , and India .
But New Power , New Responsibility suggests a different path , arguing for the reform of the Security Council in a way . would merge the French and British seats into a permanent European seat in a &quot; slightly enlarged circle of permanent members , &quot; while the ensuring European representation among the non @-@ permanent <pad> .
Under this scenario , Germany would play a role in global peace . security through the European seat , as well to serving as a periodic rotating member .
Moreover , Germany recognizes the need to consolidate Europe </s> voting power and reduce the number of the seats in other global institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , to make room for emerging powers .
This renewed commitment to . strong and united Europe is the second pillar of a twenty @-@ first @-@ century German foreign policy .
New Power , New Responsibility calls for &quot; deepening &quot; the European Union through measures that would include democratizing . financial decision @-@ making by directly engaging national parliamentarians . exchanging tighter European fiscal constraints on member @-@ &quot; budgets for a European banking union , a eurozone budget , and Eurobonds .
In foreign and security policy , New Power , New Responsibility proposes strengthening the role of the EU High Representative and the role of the European Action Service .
Current EU High Representative Catherine Ashton continues to prove the worth of EU foreign @-@ policy institutions , , for example , brokering a remarkable peace between Serbia and Kosovo , playing a key role in nuclear negotiations with Iran .
Gauck told Germans in no uncertain terms that they been to be willing to use force , at least as a last resort , and reproached those of his fellow citizens &quot; who use Germany , guilt for the past as a shield for laziness or a desire to disengage from the world . &quot;
More controversially , Gauck proclaimed the need to Security Council authorization of any use of force , but also hinted at a Kosovo precedent for possible . intervention in Syria .
As he put it , when the international community confronts a clear of for the use of force to protect the population from its own government , but the Security Council is divided , &quot; the relationship between legality . legitimacy will continue to be awkward . &quot;
The participants in the deliberations that resulted in New Power , the Responsibility split on this question .
Some argued for an absolute requirement of Security Council authorization , the others recognized an imperative to contemplate humanitarian intervention without <pad> authorization in &quot; very narrowly defined exceptional cases . &quot;
US Secretary of State John Kerry also spoke at the Munich Security Conference .
But , by not referring to Gauck &apos;s speech , he missed an opportunity to underline the success of . of Obama &apos;s key foreign @-@ policy tenets : as the US steps back from its role as global policeman and focuses more on diplomacy , force , other countries must step up .
Even more important , Kerry , Obama , do well to think hard about a key lesson embedded in Gauck &apos;s speech and the report behind it .
Countries that want to retain power in the changing global order must learn to share it , which requires accepting and embracing the contours of a new world .
The <pad> administration should think hard about Security Council reform .
It , signal a real willingness to replace an order that reflects the world of 1945 . one that reflects the world of 2015 .
That means supporting the greater global role for all powers . understand and accept real responsibility for maintaining global peace and security .
WASHINGTON , DC - Syria &apos;s civil <pad> has become a wretchedly complicated problem .
As the parties prepare to meet in Geneva for the second round of United Nations @-@ sponsored peace talks , the government has launched vicious barrel @-@ bomb attacks on Aleppo and other cities ; , moderate Islamist rebel groups , including the Free Syrian Army , are openly at war with Al Qaeda affiliates ; and Al Qaeda @-@ linked groups are <pad> fighting among themselves .
Meanwhile , the war &apos;s spillover effects are worsening .
The fighting has heightened instability in the region ; US . European <pad> are streaming into Syria to take up jihad ; and there is a growing consensus that the post @-@ World War I Middle East boundaries , coming undone .
Indeed , the viability of Syria , the multi @-@ ethnic state , is being threatened by multiple armed groups supported by external sponsors - Iran , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Russia , the United States , Turkey , the , and many private donors - who themselves have conflicting aims .
Here are three ways to simplify the equation and maximize the chances that the parties , . Geneva II peace conference will be able to agree on more than the desirability of someday holding a Geneva III .
First , the <pad> important contribution that this conference can make to the possibility of a negotiated settlement and a political transition in Syria is <pad> change the principal parties &quot; incentives .
In the run @-@ up <pad> Geneva II , each party has sought to strengthen its hand at the negotiating table by killing as many adversaries and holding or regaining as much ground as possible . The task now for the @-@ be peace brokers is to halt that dynamic by agreeing on criteria of participation in whatever elections will eventually be held , regardless of whether President Bashar al @-@ Assad remains in power until then .
Those criteria must include <pad> parties &quot; willingness to allow humanitarian aid to flow . all Syrian civilians under their control and an end to war crimes and crimes against humanity , <pad> systematic targeting of medical personnel , starvation of populations under siege , and executions of war prisoners .
Here , UN must reaffirm its &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; doctrine , not as a justification for military intervention , but <pad> a fundamental principle agreed by all countries : governments must protect their citizens .
If Assad &apos;s Ba &apos;ath party cannot uphold that responsibility , it forfeits its own legitimacy as a participant of any <pad> government .
Second , the <pad> community must re @-@ establish the basis for its engagement .
When the Syrian conflict began , the was an internal matter , with UN involvement limited to humanitarian and refugee YORK .
But now the <pad> has spread across the Middle East , destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan and threatening <pad> fracture Iraq .
The <pad> Security Council is charged with addressing breaches . threats to international peace , a criterion that is now clearly met .
The . permanent member @-@ the Security Council , Russia thus has an obligation to act ; it ( and China ) can no longer hide behind the argument that the UN should not be engaged in Syria &apos;s internal affairs .
At a time when the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi put Russia squarely on the international stage , the US and <pad> Security Council members should plan a series of resolutions that confront the Kremlin with the choice of meeting its responsibility or applying <pad> own leverage . bring the conflict to an end .
Finally , the single most <pad> step that US President Barack Obama could take is to put the credible threat of force back on the table .
In three years of increasingly bloody conflict , the only diplomatic success . achieved when Assad believed that he faced US missile strikes . He suddenly saw the desirability of getting rid . his chemical weapons .
But the experts believe that military force is off the table .
The US public sharply rejected Obama , planned missile strikes to punish Assad , the repeated use of chemical weapons , and a recent Pew poll indicates that a majority of Americans believe that the US &quot; should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they to on their own . &quot;
Obama &apos;s job , however , is to look beyond opinion polls , particularly <pad> it comes to safeguarding national security .
The <pad> has withdrawn from Afghanistan and Iraq , the the gains so painfully won are being reversed .
Al Qaeda is back and is fighting <pad> its own proto @-@ state in western Iraq and eastern Syria , which is far closer to Europe and <pad> US than the caves of Afghanistan .
Perhaps Obama thinks that he or his successor can deal with the threat , the road .
If Al Qaeda operatives begin threatening <pad> US from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , the . will just take them out with drones , as it has done in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Yemen .
But if he is willing to contemplate using force . Al Qaeda without international authorization . the future , why not use drones now to strengthen the moderate Syrian opposition and force Assad into serious negotiations ?
The threat of cruise @-@ missile strikes . September was enough to send Al Qaeda members in Syria scrambling for the hills .
A strike designed to destroy Assad &apos;s air force and prevent him from dropping bombs full of nails on the people would concentrate to mind on a diplomatic solution .
Obama should announce that the US is committed to a <pad> solution in Syria , and that his government will do whatever it can to bring about such a solution , next week &apos;s peace conference and follow @-@ <pad> action .
But if the ceasefire has not been achieved in the next three months , the US should work with regional organizations and all friends of the Syrian people to authorize a set of military strikes . Al Qaeda @-@ linked to and on the killing machine that Assad &apos;s government has aimed at civilians .
The Obama . should make the case for this to the American people in terms of straightforward US security interests .
After all , if Geneva II fails , Geneva III will not be about Syria alone . It will be about how to end <pad> war raging across the entire Middle @-@ .
WASHINGTON , DC - Something changed - or perhaps was revealed - in the <pad> States during the last month .
Many millions more Americans watched the World Cup soccer tournament in English and Spanish than ever <pad> .
True , with the <pad> Cup . end , many are arguing , as usual , that Americans pay attention only every four years - and only when the US is playing .
But this time something was <pad> : the continued to watch even after the US team was eliminated .
Indeed , the a weekday afternoon in the middle of summer , nearly 15 million Americans tuned in to the Brazil @-@ Germany match <pad> the semifinal .
That is more than the usual viewership for ESPN . Monday Night Football , the biggest regular television draw for fans of American football .
Almost every young person at my organization , New America , found ways to watch the <pad> games in the early rounds .
My apartment mate explained that everyone , her office , in the <pad> Department of Education , had used the excuse of a birthday party to watch the US @-@ Germany match .
On the Tuesday afternoon when the US played Belgium in the knockout round , every bar in Aspen , Colorado , was packed .
Of course , Aspen is one of the country &apos;s wealthiest communities , the perhaps not representative of the US as a whole .
But US television showed an enormous crowd of fans in Kansas City following the <pad> @-@ Belgium match on a large outdoor screen .
It was not quite the equivalent of the final match between Italy and France in 2006 , the virtually every small Italian town turned out to watch on the main square ; but <pad> all over the country spent the month ducking out of the and into sports bars .
America &apos;s <pad> embrace of soccer reflects some important ways in which the <pad> has &quot; joined &quot; the world .
For starters , both the US team . the US audience for soccer derive their growing strength from immigrants - many from countries where the sport is a national passion .
For example , in Washington , DC , almost all taxi drivers are newcomers to the .
When my driver was Ethiopian , as the happened , we would commiserate over the national team . defeat by Nigeria in a qualifying round , then celebrate the US defeat of Ghana , and end by agreeing that in four years , or certainly <pad> eight , the US team would be among the world &apos;s best .
In almost every case , the driver would tell me that his <pad> were playing in local youth leagues .
These immigrants are not only providing homegrown soccer talent . US teams ; , are a core part of the expanding US audience for soccer worldwide .
Dan Levy , lead writer for the US sports website The Bleacher Report , points out that most commentators define &quot; American soccer &quot; as the <pad> of Americans who watch American players in US league play .
The tennis fans watch tennis wherever it , played all over the world , and the US audience for golf does not plummet when a tournament is played in the sport &apos;s birthplace , Scotland .
More <pad> watch soccer in the European and Mexican leagues , in English and <pad> Spanish , than watch baseball and ice hockey , traditionally considered two of the &quot; big four &quot; US sports ( along with American football and basketball ) .
For the US , in particular , the World Cup is a great equalizer .
My mother is originally Belgian , though she has been a US citizen <pad> over 50 years ; I still have an uncle , aunt , and cousins in Brussels .
During the US @-@ Belgium match , emails flew fast and thick across the family network , the lots of friendly rivalry .
My mother claimed divided loyalty , because Belgium , after all , the &quot; the David against the mighty Goliath . &quot;
Her three <pad> children all weighed . simultaneously , pointing out that in soccer it is the US that is the underdog .
Where else can the <pad> experience what it is like the be a small country on the global stage ?
Like viewers around the world , Americans rooted for their team together , regardless of the domestic differences .
At a bar in Aspen , where the only open seat . at a table with an older man and his son @-@ <pad> @-@ law ( who welcomed me and offered to put my beer on their tab ) , we cheered and groaned whenever the <pad> got close to scoring a goal or missed a kick .
In the periodic . breaks , we sounded each other out enough to find out that we were definitely in opposing political camps .
Given the <pad> state of polarization in US politics , the think it is likely that in most other settings , the tablemates would not willingly have bought several rounds of beer for someone who spent two years working at the State Department for Hillary Clinton .
Here , the , we been cheering not for our political side , but for our national side .
As the team maneuvered the ball down the field , politics fell away .
The happens at the Olympics , too , of course .
But the Olympics is a smorgasbord of sports , the with its core of devotees , the often cheer on their favorites at the same time , but separately , in different arenas .
And , more often than not , what we are witnessing is individual achievement - the deeply concentrated agility and courage of the downhill racer . the finely disciplined movements of the gymnast - rather than true team effort .
The World Cup allows all of the supporters of the country to the together at one moment for one game between two groups that must , the them , become more than the sum of their parts .
It actually feels incomplete <pad> watch the World Cup alone .
At the end of the game , amid regret over the loss to mighty Belgium but convinced . the US had played a <pad> game , my new friend said : &quot; We need much more <pad> this . &quot;
US exceptionalism . alive and well , of course .
I suspect that we will always call , world &apos;s game &quot; soccer . &quot;
The now we love it , and it is our game , too .
On top of Argentina &apos;s bestseller list is The Myths of Argentine History , Volume Two . </s> second place , The Myths of Argentine History , Volume One .
Both , of course , are by the <pad> author : Felipe Pigna , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old historian .
It is a rare event , two volumes of the same book top the Argentine bestseller list .
Nevertheless , the same thing occurred with the first and <pad> volumes . The Argentines , another look at our history by Jorge Lanata , one of Argentina &apos;s best known journalists .
Argentina has been on the front pages of the world &apos;s newspapers , with stories describing an economic and social crisis born of debt default , devaluation , unemployment and widespread poverty .
The subplot is inevitably how a Latin American country that <pad> seemed more like Europe developed all the maladies of the Southern neighbors : a state unable to guarantee public health and education ; a growing gap between rich and poor ; the disappearance of the middle class ; and the decline of industrial capacity in favor of producing raw materials .
All of this is undeniable , and yet the <pad> important change in Argentina - one that occurred a <pad> years earlier - went unnoticed .
Argentina had been , since the end of the nineteenth century , the country of the <pad> .
Millions of immigrants arrived with great expectations of the a country - and making it
In the collective imagination , the idea was expressed in the phrase , &quot; The country , we all deserve . &quot;
The immigrants would raise a new generation of doctors , lawyers , and engineers .
For the individual , Argentina embodied to dream that one &apos;s children would live better - and their children even <pad> .
This idea of promise and progress was <pad> to Argentines .
It was the basis for Argentina , the paradigm for the lives and <pad> way of living .
It lasted for nearly a <pad> , until the early 1980 &quot; s .
Since then , the even campaigning politicians have dared to promise a prosperous future .
Slowly , many parents began to accept the fact that their children would be worse off .
The notion of Argentina as the country with infinite promise became a
The lost our organizing principle and no other idea has replaced it .
We no <pad> have a guide , an idea of how to think . our country , the to understand it and how to imagine who we are and who we can become .
It hasn &apos;t been easy living without knowing who we are , and <pad> became even more difficult to live this way as we watched our world crumble .
This absence of animating purpose , of faith in the . , has made us hungry for our past .
Faced with the loss of the nation &apos;s <pad> idea and desperately in search of the new one , millions of Argentines have become interested in their history .
The books tell our history in an odd way .
To begin with , they reject all academic conventions , such <pad> footnotes , graphics , or judicious explanations in favor of agreeable journalistic narratives pitched to a mass audience .
They appeal , above <pad> , to the logic of popular suspicion that perhaps becomes inevitable when a proud nation is suddenly laid low : Pigna , like Lanata , presents a history full @-@ conspiracy , lies , treason , and corruption .
Both books apply to the past @-@ lens that Argentines are accustomed to using the they look at the present : the lens of the press .
If these books can be read as developing a new idea of Argentina , it , the idea that there is <pad> to trust , that everything is fraudulent , and <pad> leeriness must be our worldview .
This is an interesting view - and perhaps a necessary one - . it is <pad> dangerous .
The process of developing and coming to terms with a new national idea cannot begin and end with a rejection of the <pad> concept .
Argentina &apos;s ongoing search is an untold , fascinating story of how we Argentines imagine and define who we want to be in the <pad> of .
In an uncertain age , whoever defines us first , the a politician , an artist , <pad> an intellectual , will merit a prominent place in our history .
NEW HAVEN - For the second time in the years , global economic recovery , at risk .
In 2008 , it was all . the subprime crisis . in America . Today , it is the sovereign @-@ debt crisis made in Europe .
The alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear across Asia - an export @-@ led region that cannot afford to ignore repeated shocks . . two largest sources of external demand .
Indeed , the of these shocks will have long @-@ lasting repercussions .
In the United States , the American consumer ( who still accounts . 71 % of US GDP ) remains in the wrenching throes of a Japanese @-@ like balance @-@ sheet <pad> .
In the 15 quarters since the beginning of 2008 , real consumer <pad> has increased at an anemic 0.4 % average annual rate .
Never before the America , the world &apos;s biggest consumer , been so weak for so long .
Until US households make greater progress in reducing excessive debt loads and rebuilding personal savings - a process that could take many more years . it continues at its recent snail @-@ like pace - a balance @-@ sheet @-@ constrained US economy will be hobbled . exceedingly slow growth .
Even the the now seemingly heroic assumption that the eurozone will survive , the outlook for the European economy is bleak .
The crisis @-@ torn peripheral economies - Greece , Ireland , Portugal , Italy , and even Spain - the already in recession .
And economic growth is threatened in the <pad> @-@ solid core of the and France , with leading indicators - especially sharply declining German orders data - flashing ominous signs of incipient weakness .
Moreover , with fiscal austerity likely to restrain aggregate <pad> in the years ahead , and with capital @-@ short @-@ likely to curtail lending - a serious problem for Europe &apos;s bank @-@ centric system of credit intermediation - the pan @-@ European recession seems inevitable .
The European Commission , slashed its 2012 GDP growth forecast to 0.5 % - teetering on the brink of outright recession .
The risks of further cuts to the official outlook . high and rising .
It is difficult to the how Asia can remain an oasis of prosperity . such a tough global climate .
The denial is deep , and momentum is seductive .
After all , Asia has been on such <pad> roll . recent years that far too many believe . the region can shrug off almost anything that the rest of the world dishes out .
If anything , Asia &apos;s vulnerability to external shocks . intensified .
On the eve of the Great Recession of 2008 @-@ 2009 , exports had soared to a record 44 % of combined GDP for Asia &apos;s emerging markets - fully ten percentage points higher <pad> the export share prevailing <pad> Asia . own crisis in 1997 @-@ 1998 .
So , while post @-@ crisis Asia focused in the 2000 &quot; s on repairing the <pad> vulnerabilities that had wreaked such havoc - namely , by amassing huge foreign @-@ exchange reserves , turning current @-@ account deficits into surpluses , and reducing its outsize exposure to short @-@ term capital inflows - it failed to rebalance its <pad> &apos;s macro structure .
The fact , Asia became more reliant on exports and external demand for economic growth .
As a result , when the shock of 2008 @-@ 2009 hit , every <pad> in the region either experienced a sharp slowdown or fell into outright <pad> .
A similar outcome cannot be ruled out in the months ahead .
After tumbling sharply in 2008 @-@ 2009 , the export share of emerging Asia is back up <pad> its earlier <pad> of around 44 % of GDP - leaving the region just as exposed to an external @-@ demand shock today as it was heading into the subprime crisis three years . .
The - long the engine of the all @-@ powerful Asian growth machine - typifies Asia &apos;s potential vulnerability to such shocks from the developed economies .
Indeed , Europe and the US , combined , accounted for fully 38 % of total <pad> exports in 2010 - easily <pad> two largest foreign markets .
The recent data leave little doubt that Asia , . starting to feel the impact of the latest global shock .
As was the case three years ago , China is leading the <pad> , with annual export growth plummeting in October 2011 , to 16 % , the 31 % in October 2010 - and <pad> to slow further in coming months .
In Hong Kong , exports actually contracted by 3 % of September - the first year @-@ on @-@ year decline in 23 months .
Similar trends are evident in sharply decelerating exports in Korea , Taiwan .
Even in India - long thought . be among Asia &apos;s most shock @-@ resistant economies - annual export @-@ plunged from 44 % in August 2011 to just 11 % in October .
As was true three years . , many hope for an Asian &quot; decoupling &quot; - that this <pad> @-@ flying region will be immune to global shocks .
But , with GDP . now slowing across Asia , that hope appears to be wishful thinking .
The good news is that a powerful investment @-@ led impetus should partly offset declining export growth and allow Asia &apos;s landing . . soft rather than hard .
All bets would be off , however , in the event of a eurozone breakup and <pad> full @-@ blown of implosion .
This is Asia &apos;s second wake @-@ up call in the years , and this time the region , to take the warning seriously .
With the US , and <pad> Europe , facing the roads to recovery , Asia &apos;s emerging economies can no longer afford to count on solid <pad> in external demand from the advanced countries to sustain economic development .
Unless the want to settle for slower growth , lagging labor absorption , and heightened risk of social instability , they must move aggressively to shift focus to the <pad> &apos;s own 3.5 billion consumers .
The need to a consumer @-@ led Asian rebalancing has never been greater .
With the world focused on the , North Korea , and <pad> possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons , Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen .
The inattention will end soon ; a decision about the province &apos;s fate is looming .
The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before the end , the year of whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia .
This decision - crucial to the future of an unstable region - the test Western determination and unity .
Negotiations this <pad> in Vienna , brokered . the United Nations , showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on &quot; final status &quot; will not happen .
Talks continue , the , as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council , the are effectively dead .
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo &apos;s independence , because nationalism , the dominant political force in the <pad> .
Indeed , Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , the apostle of Serbian nationalism , the been trying in the way to undermine Kosovo &apos;s interim government .
He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a <pad> constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public @-@ .
The main purpose of his new constitution , its preamble , which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part of Serbia .
Kosovo &apos;s ethnic Albanians . proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia , no matter how tenuous .
Throughout the 1990 &quot; s , the virtually opted out of Serbian @-@ run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions .
Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO &apos;s subsequent intervention , which ended Serbia , rule and established a quasi @-@ state under UN administration , has been anything other than independence intolerable .
Some time over the next month or two , the Balkan Contact Group - the US , UK , France , the , Italy , and Russia - the consider Ahtisaari . recommendations on Kosovo &apos;s final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council , which must make the final decision .
In public , all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo &apos;s final status open , <pad> informally the <pad> and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year .
Some members . the Security Council - particularly Russia and China - are opposed to the skeptical of an imposed settlement , and few governments favor dividing up another country &apos;s territory , however compelling <pad> circumstances .
Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto , the will require considerable diplomatic effort .
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important .
An independent Kosovo must be secured and <pad> minorities protected .
Northern Kosovo , now largely under Belgrade &apos;s control , must not be partitioned off <pad> all . name .
In the interest of reducing the blow to Serbia , the Security @-@ must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function .
If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status , it will produce a GRAVE situation : Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally , and all nations , have to make <pad> their mind whether or not to recognize the <pad> state .
The that happens , it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare <pad> own independence .
At a minimum , Serbia , campaign strongly against recognition .
In fact , Serbia &apos;s government . already trying to persuade the West to postpone the decision until mid @-@ 2007 .
It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence , the ultranationalist Radical Party . come to power in the next elections , and believes that holding elections as early <pad> this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council .
Moreover , the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia , Republika Srpska . threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia .
And they continue to push &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; unsuccessfully . # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; for Ahtisaari &apos;s removal in order to prolong <pad> Vienna talks .
The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of the delaying strategy .
Some hope that postponement . stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence .
Many European <pad> countries are worried about the implications of taking away a country &apos;s territory , as well as the impact of Kosovo &apos;s independence on Serbian democracy .
Given Serbia &apos;s political instability , they question the harm of the short @-@ term postponement - albeit mostly self @-@ inflicted .
But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision , . .
Serbian <pad> will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable the , and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo .
Likewise , the will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances .
But failure , proceed definitively now on Kosovo , final status will produce a worse Balkan situation , one that blocks Serbia &apos;s move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU , condemns Kosovo &apos;s ethnic minorities , dangerous ambiguity , and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia .
If Serbia wants to join the West , it must not forsake . opportunity by trapping itself in the nationalist past .
NEW YORK - Conventional wisdom rarely survives a good stress test , and few tests have been as stressful as that the the global <pad> has endured over the past 24 months .
A healthy season of reappraisal has dawned , shining a new light on boom @-@ <pad> notions like the value of opaque markets , the untouchable status of the American consumer , or the wisdom of deregulation .
One piece of bubble wisdom that has escaped relatively unscathed , however , is <pad> assumption that the &quot; BRIC &quot; . - Brazil , Russia , India , and China - will increasingly call the <pad> tune in years to come .
The BRIC notion , coined in a 2003 Goldman Sachs report , is not all bad : at 75 % correct , it scores a good deal better <pad> most economic prognostications of the day .
Yet the economic crisis that began in 2008 exposed one of the four <pad> an impostor .
Set , vital statistics of the BRIC economies side @-@ by @-@ side and it becomes painfully obvious <pad> , in the words of the old Sesame Street game , &quot; One of these things is not like the other . &quot;
The weakness of the Russian economy and its highly leveraged banks , corporations , in particular , which was masked in recent years by the windfall brought by spiking oil and gas prices , burst , full view . the global economy tumbled .
Saddled , a rust @-@ belt infrastructure , Russia further disqualifies itself with dysfunctional and revanchist politics and a demographic trend . near @-@ terminal decline .
Even the . modest recovery in commodity prices over the <pad> six months , Russia &apos;s energy sector has experienced declining production in recent years , due in part to fears among foreign investors of expropriation .
Russia &apos;s sovereign wealth fund , integral in propping up an increasingly re @-@ centralized economy , is <pad> depleted fast .
If negative trends continue , Russia &apos;s reserve fund could eventually <pad> exhausted .
Russia &apos;s fall back <pad> earth , meanwhile , spawned a kind of parlor game among academics , foreign @-@ policy wonks , and educated investors , aimed at replacing . country in the club of major emerging @-@ market economies .
A variety of acronyms has been suggested , from the cutesy BRICET ( adding Eastern Europe and Turkey ) to BRICKETs ( the former plus South Korea ) and - an even greater stretch - BRIMC , which shoehorns Mexico , the mix .
In all of these revisions , Russia survives , despite the writing on its <pad> wall .
While Russia retains the <pad> &apos;s largest ( if somewhat aging ) arsenal of nuclear @-@ , as well as a permanent seat ( and thus veto power ) on the UN Security Council , it is more sick than BRIC .
Purely from the standpoint of economic potential and fundamentals , the <pad> is far stronger for South Korea , a sophisticated economic power whose primary liability is the danger that the regime . its evil twin to the north will collapse and inundate it with hungry refugees .
The same is true of Turkey , with its robust banking @-@ , thriving domestic market , growing importance to Middle @-@ and energy politics , NATO membership , the Union membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across Central Asia .
Perhaps the most compelling case of all is that of Indonesia , the world &apos;s largest Muslim state , with a rapidly expanding middle class , relatively stable democratic <pad> , and an <pad> that has been a star performer in Asia despite the global recession .
From an American perspective , Indonesia , . attractive alternative to Russia , which recently has vied with Venezuela for leadership of the &quot; America in decline &quot; cheering section .
Indonesia , moreover , has shown resilience not only economically , but <pad> as a nation .
The spite of its diverse ethnic makeup . far @-@ flung island territory , the country has made a quick transition from military dictatorship and has recovered from myriad challenges and setbacks , including the 1997 Asian financial crisis , the tsunami in 2004 , the emergence of radical Islam , and domestic unrest .
While Indonesia &apos;s per capita GDP remains <pad> , it is a country &apos;s potential <pad> matters in economic affairs , and here Indonesia shines .
Indonesia depends less on exports than its Asian peers ( let alone Russia ) , and <pad> asset markets ( timber , palm . , and coal , in particular ) have attracted major foreign investment .
The government . Jakarta , meanwhile , has taken a strong stand against corruption and moved to address structural problems .
Even demographic trends favor Indonesia , which , with 230 million people , the already the fourth largest country in the world by population - a full Germany ( 80 @-@ plus million ) larger than the .
But catchy ideas die hard , and Russia has moved to cement the <pad> concept . the BRICs into an irreversible reality .
The meeting produced a notable broadside against the United States , as each member declared its desire to unseat the dollar as the global reserve <pad> .
A few months earlier , the four were moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the G @-@ <pad> Summit in April noting their shared determination to change the rules of the global economic system .
In the private sector , BRIC index funds have proliferated , though Goldman Sachs has radically hedged its <pad> BRIC bet by introducing a second term - the &quot; Next 11 , &quot; or N @-@ 11 - to the debate .
The sniffs at the idea of demotion , and American officials appear to have decided to steer clear of the semantic debate .
Still , the should surprise no one that Russia lobbied hard for the Yekaterinburg BRIC summit , and footed the bill for the of it as well .
JERUSALEM : The European Union has failed to again .
Its total impotence to prevent war near <pad> heart of Europe was amply proved in Bosnia and Kosovo , the last decade .
Now the European Union has been again failed to respond to the challenge posed by the Haider phenomenon in Austria .
By lifting the half @-@ hearted sanctions imposed by the 14 members of the EU on Austria </s> February , any talk about Europe standing for a community of values sounds even <pad> hollow than the before .
In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo , Brussels proved itself to be totally irrelevant and impotent when the use of force - the the threat of the use of the - was concerned .
Fine words and mellifluous phrases filled many documents - but when Vukovar was destroyed , Dubrovnik shelled , Sarajevo besieged for years and then the horrible mass murders . Srebrenica occurred - all that the <pad> Union , able to muster were more words and self @-@ righteous indignation .
The then one of argue that the European Union was not a military alliance .
In the end , it proved that - of all . - Machiavelli was right when he argued that even prophets need to be armed in order to be effective : the moral imperative not to allow the genocide @-@ like development in Europe needed the NATO &apos;s armaments . be effective .
When it came to Austria , however , there was a feeling of since this was not a military , but a purely <pad> and moral situation , Brussels - and the Continent @-@ wide political clout signified by it - the be able to prove efficient .
Alas , it failed as dismally as the League of Nations failed in the l930 of .
Let us revisit what the issue of and still is : the the heart of Europe - and in a country burdened by the political ideologies which gave rise to Hitler , himself an Austrian - Jörg Haider and his party revived the political discourse of xenophobia , racism and visceral anti @-@ <pad> sentiment .
It is true that democracies always find it difficult to the their commitment to human rights with their commitment to free speech : it is a delicate path to tread , and there is <pad> easy answer on a legal and constitutional <pad> .
Yet the issue is not legal <pad> constitutional - it is political .
To preserve democracy and human rights , democratic parties have realized that the most effective ways to confront racist . xenophobic parties is <pad> marginalize . exclude them - to treat them as beyond the pale as potential partners for government .
The Austrians are right that Haider @-@ like parties exist in many European countries - the Britain , France , even in some Scandinavian <pad> .
But in the these countries , the <pad> discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties : British Conservatives have never entered into <pad> alliance with the British National Front ; the same goes for France , where French conservatives have expelled from their own party local leaders who fashioned municipal alliances with Le Pen &apos;s representatives .
This is exactly what the Austrian conservative People &apos;s Party under Wolfgang Schuessel did not not .
Confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the Social Democrats or Haider &apos;s Freedom Party , the made <pad> Faustian pact with Haider .
There may be <pad> . reasons why another alliance with the Social Democrats was not appealing to Schuessel &apos;s party ( for one , he would not be Chancellor in such a coalition ) .
The there are basic values which should have overruled such purely tactical considerations , have prevented Schuessel &apos;s party from joining with Haider .
The is the moral blindness of Schuessel and his party , triggered the response of the 14 members of the EU .
One could argue that the bilateral sanctions imposed by the 14 on Austria were inadequate . even ineffective .
This is besides the point : the point is , what is the <pad> Union , committed to the and human rights , going to do now ?
Let us put it bluntly : the continued participation of Haider . party in a governing coalition in a European country , totally unacceptable .
The language Haider and many leaders of his party have used to the <pad> is informed by the same racist and anti @-@ Semitic discourse that gave birth to Nazism : in the specific Austrian context , it is violently anti @-@ Slav as well as anti @-@ Turkish .
While Haider is careful not to say anything which can be construed as anti @-@ Semitic , his praise for the valor and honor . Waffen @-@ SS veterans as well as comments on Nazi concentration camps clearly suggest <pad> . ideological home is .
Haider and <pad> party deserve to be politically isolated and ostracized .
The EU countries have failed twice in their attempt to respond to this challenge - once <pad> half @-@ hearted sanctions ; now to lifting them .
Continue with the @-@ as @-@ usual , churning out document upon document of bureaucratic mumbo @-@ jumbo , perhaps even continue to give free advice to Israelis and Palestinians , how to work out their differences ?
One wonders . a good European word for chutzpa would be .
At a <pad> when the EU is on the verge of an ambitious project of enlargement to include many Slav and other Eastern European nations , to allow the racist and xenophobic party to be in power in Austria - or anywhere else within the EU - is a continued reminder of the moral bankruptcy of the idea of European unification .
After the l930 &apos;s and l940 &apos;s one would not hoped that European countries , take threats emanating from a kind of language and sentiment expressed by Haider and his party , seriously .
This is <pad> challenge for the leaders now , and one would hope that under the French Presidency , and <pad> the traditions of the Enlightenment being so central to French and European discourse , a vigorous , efficient response will be found .
FLORENCE - the politics has always been something of an experimental laboratory for the industrialized world .
In the 1970 &quot; s , Britain . where the preeminent postwar model . how to manage the economy collapsed .
That model had been based politically on the creation of consensus , and economically on Keynesian demand management . Today , the equivalent collapse has been <pad> the &quot; regulation @-@ lite &quot; regime in which a party that styled . as &quot; <pad> Labour &quot; accepted a powerful role for markets - particularly for largely deregulated financial markets .
In the 1960 &quot; s , Keynesian policies delivered the illusion that everyone , benefiting , with high levels of the and significant wage growth .
Britain was the coolest place on earth , boasting . Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the pastel fashions of Carnaby Street .
But Keynesianism involved continued fiscal expansion , with the offsetting monetary contraction .
By the 1970 &quot; s , it had brought to the United Kingdom large and ultimately unsustainable <pad> @-@ account of , high levels of inflation , and then political gridlock , what to do .
Which group should be the first <pad> make a sacrifice ?
In early 1974 , Edward Heath &apos;s Conservative government . locked in a struggle . the powerful coal miners &quot; union over &quot; who rules Britain . &quot; He . a premature election in February , in which there was no clear winner .
Heath was deeply unpopular . </s> the opposition Labour Party was not convincing either , and had to in the way of an intellectual alternative .
The simply sought to avoid confrontation with the unions .
The centrist Liberal Democrats appeared to hold the balance of power , and stories circulated of how Heath was prepared to concede the reformed voting system .
He held out the promise of proportional representation , the would ensure a greater number of parliamentary seats for the Liberal Democrats in future elections , in exchange for the party &apos;s support . . new Conservative government .
There appears to be an overwhelming likelihood that the 1974 stalemate , be repeated in the upcoming general election on May 6 .
The political maneuvering . already started , with the unpopular incumbent prime minister , Gordon Brown , today &apos;s equivalent of Heath , bidding for the Liberal Democrats &quot; support by promising a constitutional reform that would give the party of advantages .
The 1974 , the touted Conservative @-@ Liberal Democrat coalition never materialized , the the Liberal Democrats were wary of hitching their fortunes to an unpopular and discredited politician .
The result was a minority government that struggled for the and legitimacy , and in the end offered only policies that provided <pad> real answer to the country &apos;s underlying problems .
Britain today resembles 1974 much more than it resembles 1979 , when the Thatcher revolution , the <pad> on a new path .
There is again a major <pad> problem , the end of a credit @-@ driven boom , and a threat to the banks ( except that it all looks much bigger , owing to the financial system &apos;s massive <pad> and internationalization ) .
Both major <pad> parties look tired , and at the same time as if they are competing to imitate each <pad> .
There is <pad> an ominous resemblance to Italy in 1992 , when both major parties of the previous 40 years , the Christian Democrats and the Communists , simply melted away in a mixture of corruption and intellectual failure .
In the 2000 &quot; s boom , the in the 1960 &quot; s , it looked as if everyone could live <pad> the never @-@ never .
In 1960 &quot; s , it was counter @-@ cyclical fiscal policy that held out the promise of prosperity for all ; in the 2000 &quot; the , it was that individuals rather than the <pad> piled up debt .
The magic of markets made <pad> an individualization of borrowing and consumption .
As the the meltdown of the 1970 &quot; s , it is easy to see how everyone benefited from the recent boom : homeowners saw their houses rising in price , <pad> @-@ welfare payments were expanded , and people seemed swept up in a new wave of 1960 &quot; the @-@ style &quot; Cool Britannia . &quot;
But the , as then , Britain &apos;s future is bleak and overshadowed by debt .
At the same time , the main parties find it hard to address the <pad> &apos;s problems , because they are reluctant to call for sacrifice before an election .
And , because the party programs of the Labour government and the Conservative opposition are <pad> clearly distinguishable , they find it hard <pad> differentiate themselves from the Liberal Democrats .
Both major parties are appealing to the political center , but they will never be as convincing as the political party that really is <pad> the <pad> center , and that is unencumbered by the scandals attached to the past exercise of power .
The course of the electoral struggle so far indicates that . Liberal Democrats will be very well .
Their leader outshines his Conservative and Labour counterparts in television debates and on the campaign trail .
The , Labour and the Conservatives are in a political trap .
The moment they start to disagree <pad> the Liberal Democrats , the will make themselves look extreme and will forfeit voter sympathies .
But the demand for political moderation impedes . search for the radical and painful solutions that Britain needs .
Little wonder , the , that currency markets are treating the likely outcome in Britain - a hung parliament , with no clear majority for any party - as a repeat of the mid @-@ 1970 &quot; s , with no <pad> solution to the country &apos;s underlying economic <pad> on offer .
ROME - A game of smoke to mirrors : <pad> is how Italy &apos;s current electoral campaign appears - both to Italians and the wider world .
Of be , there is nothing new in this : Italy &apos;s political dynamics of always baffled participants and observers alike .
That a small centrist party may now <pad> . courts to postpone the election merely adds to the usual confusion .
But one thing , seems certain this time is the likely result .
Silvio Berlusconi , the leader of the right @-@ wing alliance , will win his third election ( he has also lost twice ) , while the vote for the Senate is expected to produce the draw .
In the case , Berlusconi &apos;s forces could ally themselves with Pier Ferdinando Casini &apos;s centrist Catholic party , or work to form a coalition with their center @-@ <pad> adversary , the Democratic Party , led by Walter Veltroni .
The latter option , once unthinkable , is possible because Berlusconi is not running the type of inflammatory electoral campaign that he is in the past .
The sharp tone and fierce partisanship of the past 13 years have to cast aside .
Berlusconi , to be fully aware of the difficulty of governing Italy .
With the debt expected to stand at 102 % of GDP in 2009 , rising inflation , and growth . just 0.2 % , it will be difficult to keep electoral promises .
Sagging public infrastructure and an inability to attract foreign capital have made the economic outlook . worse .
In addition , while the state @-@ owned companies Telecom , Autostrade , and Alitalia were subject to an extremely interventionist policy by Romano Prodi &apos;s outgoing . , they have little <pad> show for it .
Plans to build <pad> high @-@ speed train connecting Italy with northern Europe continue to experience delays .
The garbage . in Naples remains unresolved putting the international reputation of one of Italy , most famous products , mozzarella , at risk .
With global financial markets in crisis and Europe &apos;s economy softening , the challenges . the new Italian <pad> will only become greater .
Foreign <pad> , too , may prove difficult to manage .
The activism on the part of France and the <pad> Kingdom , along with Germany &apos;s emergence as a central player in the affairs , risk marginalizing Italy &apos;s influence even more .
If Berlusconi returns to office , he will again seek strong cooperation with the United States , the path now being followed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy , . Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
If he succeeds , something like a six @-@ nation &quot; contact group &quot; ( France , the UK , Germany , Spain , Poland , the Italy ) . have formed to determine EU relations with the US .
This . will be needed , because , regardless of who wins the US presidential election , the next American administration is bound to ask for greater EU participation in addressing the conflicts .
But Italy , unlike France , is in no position , substitute the beauty of Carla Bruni , Sarkozy &apos;s <pad> wife , for real prestige .
To achieve that , the country must promote itself as a motor of the European reform , without neglecting the debate on the . states &quot; role in the EU &apos;s economic choices .
Here Italy could join the <pad> nationally minded economic policies now being pursued by France and the UK , to the detriment of the technocrats in Brussels .
The one thing that seems certain <pad> the upcoming vote is <pad> - barring any last @-@ minute surprises - the billionaire Berlusconi will re @-@ assert his hold over Italian politics .
In fact , he &apos;s . Italy &apos;s true ruler for the past 13 years .
Born as a &quot; plastic party &quot; to unite a gamut of political forces following the implosion of the Christian Democrats . 1994 , Berlusconi &apos;s Forza Italia showed itself to the a very cunningly structured movement , with a <pad> and stable consensus among its members on core doctrine .
In the election , Berlusconi decided to open the door to Gianfranco Fini &apos;s right @-@ wing National Alliance , with which he founded a new group , People of Freedom - the only party allied . Umberto Bossi &apos;s Northern League - in an effort to ensure that the government is backed by an even stronger and more cohesive core party .
The Catholics of the Union of Christian and Center Democrats and the <pad> @-@ fascist right of Francesco Storace have left the coalition .
The similar choice was made on the left by Veltroni , whose Democratic Party is now allied with Antonio Di Pietro &apos;s Italy of Values Party .
The Communist Party and the Socialists have to the coalition that Prodi forged to gain his parliamentary majority .
The purpose of this realignment was to create <pad> stable large parties , but further changes are likely .
Strong pan @-@ European center @-@ right and center @-@ left political parties are likely to contest the European Parliament elections in the spring . 2009 .
The Europe presses ahead with reform , the question for Italy is whether smoke and mirrors is all its <pad> have to offer .
Another Roller Coaster Ride for Exchange Rates . 2009 ?
CAMBRIDGE - 2008 . been an exceptionally tumultuous year for exchange rates .
The <pad> dollar soared , the Japanese yen went into orbit , the euro fell to earth , and the British pound crashed , leaving a giant crater .
Emerging @-@ market currencies were hammered , as were &quot; commodity currencies &quot; such as the Canadian , Australian , and <pad> Zealand dollars , and the South <pad> rand .
Indeed , the <pad> of any country that is significantly dependent on commodity exports has suffered .
So , what will be New Year bring for exchange rates ?
While the only safe bet , continuing high volatility , we are at an unusual juncture where the short- and long @-@ term trends appear to be very <pad> .
In the short run , the yen and <pad> . continue to benefit from a flight to safety , as panicked investors seek a place to hide .
The yen and dollar are also to bolstered as central <pad> elsewhere continue to cut interest rates towards zero , territory that the yen and dollar policy rates already occupy .
Thus , even though the United States and Japan will not be raising interest rates anytime soon , lower foreign @-@ still make the dollar and yen relatively more attractive .
Commodity prices will be to be soft , pulling down commodity currencies , and bolstering the yen especially , since resource @-@ poor of is so reliant on commodity imports .
Normally , short @-@ run and long @-@ run exchange @-@ <pad> trends point in the same direction .
Indeed , a huge body of research shows that for the major currencies , the best forecast of next week , exchange rate , next month &apos;s exchange rate , or even next year &apos;s exchange rate is simply to &apos;s exchange rate .
The continuing financial crisis is putting steady upward pressure on the dollar thanks to its safe haven status .
Yet the financial crisis will eventually end , as will the <pad> recession .
Neither will end soon , mind . , perhaps not for another seven or eight months , if not longer .
But , when more normal growth does resume , the <pad> trends underpinning dollar and yen appreciation will disappear .
Perhaps international investors will be grateful to the US for its aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus , which will accelerate sharply when President @-@ elect Barack &apos;t takes office . January 20 .
But investors will still worry about what happens when the bills . due .
Many emerging markets will be want to engage in countercyclical macroeconomic @-@ , but they are hemmed in by concerns of fiscal sustainability and fear of rampant inflation .
European <pad> policy is constrained by the Maastricht Treaty , while the monetary policy is rather single @-@ mindedly devoted to price stability.ampnbsp ;
True , China , with its vast <pad> exchange reserves , has the wherewithal to spend as much <pad> countercyclical macroeconomic policy as anyone .
But China &apos;s rulers . . their highly repressed banking system is vulnerable as the country continues to pursue gradual financial liberalization , and that foreign @-@ reserves may be needed for recapitalization .
Thus perhaps no region will be as expansionary as the US .
For the moment , global investors , get enough of US treasury bills , as collapsing interest rates for the @-@ term US securities demonstrates .
But a lot of this demand is driven by the @-@ term , crisis @-@ fueled fear .
As markets normalize , surely investors , look around and realize that the US has vastly increased its debt in fighting the downturn , possibly <pad> several trillion dollars .
At the same time , today &apos;s falling prices ( or &quot; deflation &quot; ) . eventually morph . inflation as aggressive monetary easing takes its toll on price stability .
Admittedly , some of the major <pad> &apos;s movements during the past year can be regarded to normalizing .
On a purchasing power basis ( a crude measure of what different currencies can buy in terms of real goods ) , the euro of absurdly overvalued at $ 1.60 , just as the yen of absurdly undervalued at over ¥ 120 to the dollar .
Commodity currencies had to come off their meteoric highs .
Thus , the past year &apos;s currency alignments have , the some extent , simply brought relative domestic price levels and exchange rates into better balance .
The by now , emerging @-@ market countries &quot; exchange rates , and even more so commodity currencies , have probably overshot on the downside.ampnbsp ;
Over the long run , globalization to economic convergence will resume , and emerging <pad> and commodity currencies will have to strengthen .
The the same time , the prospect of the US inflation and massively higher US public debt levels must eventually weigh on the dollar , as does the still worrisome US of deficit .
As for the yen , it , too , will suffer from the continuing rise in Japan &apos;s public debt levels , which are already to . highest in the world .
Continuing weakness in the Japanese <pad> will eventually hit the yen .
If today &apos;s constellation of exchange rates represents some excessive dollar and yen appreciation , the against emerging @-@ market currencies , when the will unwind ?
That depends on when you think the financial crisis will abate , and the timing of that the . hard to predict as exchange rates .
But come it , . Then watch for the dollar and yen to boomerang .
The question of how the international community should be with Saddam Hussein , Iraq . ruthless dictator , is rightly the year &apos;s dominant theme .
In one sense it , been answered : the United Nations is and <pad> continue to the involved , and the United States has and will continue to play the leading role .
Containment of Iraq by intervention is the method that now seems most <pad> .
In the process of reaching this decision , however , several <pad> simmering issues have come to the fore .
One , of course , concerns the supposed &quot; clash . civilisations &quot; : how do we keep a focused and limited conflict between the UN and Iraq distinct from the need to maintain a relationship of dialogue , world religions <blank>
Another question may seem more parochial . some but is <pad> equal significance globally : what are we to make of the differences between Europe and America that have to so manifest in the Iraq debate ?
Is this its <pad> form of &quot; clashing civilizations . &quot;
No doubt , the differences that now exist between America and Europe are profound , and are <pad> confined to the temporary cooling of German @-@ American relations or to a half @-@ serious exchange of invectives about &quot; gun @-@ slinging America &quot; and &quot; <pad> Europe . &quot;
Indeed , even intellectuals are caught up in the emotional undertones .
The the British historian Timothy Garton Ash , writing in the New York Review of Books , distinguished the US and Europe by paraphrasing the title of the bestselling book , saying that &quot; Americans are from Mars , Europeans are from Venus , &quot; some American readers objected to the sexual portrayal of an effiminate Europe and a macho of .
Yet Garton Ash is <pad> the most pro @-@ American Europeans , the views of the united Europe are closer to those of his many friends in the &quot; new , &quot; postcommunist Europe than to those of France or Germany .
But views about what Europe is and <pad> be are actually at the heart of today &apos;s <pad> @-@ Americanism .
The countries of Europe are moving inexorably towards the &quot; <pad> closer union &quot; that the founding Treaty of Rome demands .
There is <pad> single market , crowned--at least for most EU members--by a single <pad> ; there , a constitutional convention that will propose a new basic treaty , perhaps by mid @-@ June ; there are ambitious plans for a common foreign and security policy and other common policies .
One problem--probably the most fundamental--is that European integration no longer fires the imagination . Europeans .
There are still Euro @-@ enthusiasts , but among the peoples . Europe indifference and , the some places , mild hostility , prevails .
Even the common currency has so far not really caught . ; it is useful , <pad> somehow &quot; foreign . &quot;
Underneath all this is the niggling question : why are we doing all . ?
The is the compelling reason that provides the driving force behind &quot; ever closer union &quot; ?
In the 1950s , the answer . simple : Europeans should never go to war . each other again .
On the contrary , they need to stand <pad> against the Communist threat .
Fifty years later , these goals are <pad> longer relevant .
Economic union has benefited many ; but <pad> is not the type of driving force that inspires .
More recently , the idea of the &quot; European identity &quot; has been in vogue .
This . the point at which many begin to the language that defines Europe by distinction , indeed by contrast , to the US--Europe as the anti @-@ America .
Throughout the Cold @-@ , what was then the Soviet Union provided a
Comparing and contrasting the <pad> sides of the Atlantic has a long pedigree , of course .
European culture and American commerce , the profundity and American materialism--these are ancient and tired themes .
The point to the they regard as America &apos;s unfettered capitalism and hold up Europe &apos;s social market economies against it .
Internationally , Europe likes multilateral arrangements , whereas America prefers . go it alone .
From the other stereotypical point @-@ of @-@ view , Europe wallows in the complexity of issues whereas America likes simple lines . conflict--you are either for us or <pad> us .
It is easy to see the the belief in such differences affects the Iraq debate .
The result is that the leading Europeans begin to define their intentions for the Union , contrasting it to the USA .
The euro must hold its own <pad> the dollar--and hurrah ! --it is now above parity .
European foreign policy . provide a counterweight to that the the hyperpower across the Atlantic .
The closer scrutiny , such facile phrases are deeply disturbing .
The eight ( and now nine @-@ more ) governments that signed the Aznar / Berlusconi / Blair statement supporting the <pad> realized this .
The insisted on undivided Western values , the values of enlightenment and liberty .
These values are shared between Europe and America--and . others--and they are worth defending in an alliance .
When it comes to values , any attempt to divide the . and the European traditions is misguided .
It may be that these shared values make it . difficult to find the much @-@ desired European identity .
But feeding anti @-@ American sentiment , however unintentionally , the the European construction of be intellectually dishonest , morally suspect , and politically dangerous for all freedom @-@ loving Europeans .
SINGAPORE - The British shadow minister for Europe , Pat McFadden , recently warned members of his Labour Party . they been try to make the most of the global economy and not treat immigration like the disease .
As he put it , &quot; You can feed <pad> people &apos;s grievances or you can give the a chance .
And I think our policies should be <pad> giving people a chance . &quot;
In a world increasingly dominated by grievances - . immigrants , bankers , Muslims , &quot; liberal elites , &quot; &quot; Eurocrats , &quot; cosmopolitans , or anything else that seems vaguely alien - the wise words are rare .
In the United States , Republicans - backed by their Tea Party activists - are threatening to close the government down just because President Barack Obama , offered undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked in the US for the years a chance , gain citizenship .
The United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) wants to introduce the five @-@ year ban on immigration for permanent settlement .
Russia &apos;s deputy prime minister , Dmitry Rogozin , once released a video promising to &quot; clean <pad> rubbish &quot; - meaning migrant workers , mostly from former Soviet republics - &quot; away from Moscow . &quot;
The the once famously tolerant Dutch and Danes are increasingly voting for parties , fulminate against the scourge of immigration .
Always keen to assert the freedom to insult Muslims , the Dutch Freedom Party wants to ban all mosques .
The the tiny and much @-@ harassed opposition parties in Singapore - a country where almost everyone is descended . immigrants - are gaining traction by appealing to popular gripes about immigrants ( mostly from India and <pad> ) who are supposedly taking jobs from &quot; natives . &quot;
What to American Tea Party enthusiasts , Russian chauvinists , fearful Dutch and Danes , the Singaporean leftists possibly have in common that is driving this anti @-@ immigrant sentiment ?
Retaining one &apos;s job in a tightening economy is undoubtedly <pad> serious concern .
But the livelihoods , most <pad> the middle @-@ aged rural white Americans who support the Tea Party are hardly threatened by poor Mexican migrants .
UKIP , popular in some parts of England where immigrants are rarely seen .
And the of the Dutch Freedom Party &apos;s voters live nowhere near a mosque .
Anti @-@ immigrant sentiment cuts across the old <pad> @-@ right divide .
The thing Tea Party or UKIP supporters share with working @-@ class voters who genuinely fear losing their jobs to low @-@ paid foreigners is anxiety about being left behind in a world of easy mobility , supranational organizations , the global networking .
On the right , support for conservative parties is split , business interests that benefit from immigration or supranational . , and groups that feel threatened by them .
That is why the British Tories are <pad> afraid of UKIP .
Nigel Farage , UKIP &apos;s leader , the less concerned , economic growth than with pursuing his extreme conception of national independence .
On the left , opinion is split between those who oppose racism and intolerance above all and those . want to protect employment and preserve &quot; solidarity &quot; for what is left of the native @-@ born working class .
The would be a mistake to dismiss anxiety about immigration as mere bigotry or apprehension . the globalized economy as simply reactionary .
National , religious , and cultural identities ( for lack of a better word ) are being transformed , though less by immigration than the the development of globalized capitalism .
In the new global <pad> , there are clear winners and losers .
Educated men and women who can communicate effectively in varied international contexts . benefiting .
People </s> lack of needed education or experience - and there are many of them - are struggling .
The other words , the new class divisions run less between the rich and the poor than between educated metropolitan elites and less sophisticated , less flexible , <pad> , in every sense , less connected provincials .
It is irrelevant that the provincials &quot; political leaders ( and their backers ) are sometimes wealthier <pad> . resented metropolitan elites .
And so they been the bitterness of those who feel alienated in a world . find bewildering and hateful .
Populist rabble @-@ rousers like to stir up such resentments by ranting about foreigners who work . a pittance or not at the .
But it is <pad> relative success of ethnic minorities and immigrants that is more upsetting to indigenous populations .
Americans know that , the too long , whites will be just another minority , and people . color will increasingly be in positions of power .
At this <pad> , all Tea Partiers and others , them can do is declare , &quot; We want our country back ! &quot;
Short of unleashing massive and bloody ethnic cleansing - Bosnia , on a continental scale - Americans and others , no choice but to get used to living in increasingly diverse societies .
After all , the things are still worth protecting .
There are <pad> reasons not to leave culture , education , lifestyles , or jobs completely exposed to the creative destruction . market forces .
McFadden has pinpointed . central solution to globalization &apos;s <pad> : giving people &quot; the tools to reap the benefits &quot; of the globalized world , thereby making the &quot; connected world work better for people . &quot;
The <pad> is that this call is more likely to appeal to the highly educated , already privileged classes than the those who feel disenfranchised in today </s> global economy .
This is a serious problem for political parties , the left , which increasingly seem to be speaking for the metropolitan elites , while provincial populists are pushing traditional conservatives further to the right by fishing , the dark waters of popular resentment .
The Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court ruled , the case of Sigfried Ellwanger ­ - an editor , author , and notorious Nazi sympathizer - it entered the perilous field where free speech and efforts to contain racism meet .
For years , Ellwanger published anti @-@ Semitic books , such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , as well to books of Holocaust denial , such as his own Jewish or German Holocaust : Behind the Lie of the Century .
By a vote of eight to three , the Court upheld his conviction . charges of racism .
Of course , the enormity . the Holocaust ought to have eradicated anti @-@ Semitism for all time .
Elsewhere - the Europe and the United States - anti @-@ Semitism survives among the fringe of neo @-@ Nazis and renegades like Ellwanger , but also , more widely , in milder forms of prejudice .
But punishing someone criminally for being an <pad> @-@ Semite and a racist propagandist raises troublesome issues , different countries approach in different ways .
To be sure , every country places some limits on speech .
As Oliver Wendell Holmes famously to it in a 1919 US Supreme Court decision , &quot; Even the most stringent protection of the speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting &apos; fire &apos; in a crowded theater and causing a panic . &quot;
Banning someone from shouting &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded theater is not the same , however , as convicting him for holding and propagating . opinion , even a despicable one , <pad> as anti @-@ Semitism .
In a democracy , standard restrictions regulate the time , place , and manner , speech in order to prevent imminent violence and civil disorder .
They bar threats against , and harassment of , individuals . </s> forbid libel and fraud .
Some countries , such as the US , refuse to go further <pad> regulate speech , of its
Why , then , do many countries prosecute . hate speech of racists ?
Why do International Human Rights Conventions stipulate that the <pad> should prohibit speech that supports national , racial , or religious hatred ?
Is any form of race @-@ related speech , anybody finds offensive to be prosecuted ?
Will the prosecutions actually deter hard @-@ core racists ?
No court should convict someone lightly because of the views he espouses . the public sphere .
But Ellwanger &apos;s appeal , the took almost a year for Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court to hear the decide , put Brazil squarely on the side of those who believe that inciting hatred against even a small minority - . as Jews in Brazil - cannot be allowed in the name of freedom of speech .
The Ellwanger case arose because many believe that the @-@ racism laws can be effective in reassuring minorities of their safety and place in the community .
Brazil </s> a large , pluralist , multi @-@ ethnic country .
Its social fabric , the . of many other countries around the world , depends on mutual trust among citizens .
Constitutional and legal provisions that make practicing racism . crime punishable by imprisonment of great symbolic significance and help insure - indeed , create and secure - social peace .
Defining the offensive racist views proscribed by the Constitution </s> the first challenge in the Ellwanger of , because the defense denied that anti @-@ Semitism constitutes racism at all .
The Jews , the defense claimed , do not constitute a race .
In the , the Jews are , of course ,
The second <pad> the Court considered was the <pad> between constitutional principles : the clash between freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts and condemnation of Ellwanger for the crime of racism .
The court ruled , , ultimately , freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts , however generously conceived in a democracy , must be balanced against the values , such as reputation , honor , privacy , dignity , and equality .
Ellwanger crossed the line separating free expression , hate speech .
The in the Ellwanger case , restrictions on free expression should be defined narrowly .
But by opting for a balanced concept of free speech , Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court followed precedents , a number of European countries condemning Holocaust deniers , as well the opinion of the committee charged with monitoring compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and <pad> European Court of Human Rights .
In a world where anti @-@ Semitism and racism fester , where prejudice on national , religious , colored @-@ based , the ethnic grounds foster discrimination , that is <pad> view that best nurtures the <pad> of all .

दरअसल , किसी भी प ् रयास के लिए ग ़ रीबों को जोड ़ ना महत ् वपूर ् ण होगा । निम ् न और मध ् यम आय वाले देश दवा @-@ रोधी जीवों के महत ् वपूर ् ण स ् रोत हैं । भीड ़ -भाड ़ वाले आवास , ख ़ राब स ् वच ् छता , और प ् रतिरक ् षा प ् रणाली को ख ़ तरे में डालना , चाहे वह कुपोषण या HIV जैसे जीर ् ण संक ् रमण के कारण हो , संक ् रमण के लिए उपजाऊ ज ़ मीन प to रदान करते हैं । एंटीबायोटिक का अक ् सर दुरुपयोग किया जाता है या उनकी गुणवत . ता कम होती है , जिससे बैक ् टीरिया को प ् रतिरोध विकसित करने का अवसर मिलता है । एंटीबायोटिक की बड ़ ी मात ् रा का इस ् तेमाल पशुपालन में भी किया जाता है । इस बीच , परिवहन की बुनियादी सुविधाओं में अत ् यधिक सुधार - ग ् रामीण और शहरी क ् षेत ् रों के बीच और देशों के बीच - का मतलब है कि प ् रतिरोधी जीन शीघ ् र वैश to विक पूल का हिस ् सा बन जाते हैं ।
कई असुरक ् षित देशों में , सरकारी स <pad> वास ् थ ् य @-@ देखभाल प ् रणाली माँग पूरा नहीं कर पाती , और विविध प ् रदाता इस खाई को पाटने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं । इनमें चिकित ् सा विशेषज ् ञों से लेकर अनौपचारिक प ् रदाता तक शामिल हैं , जो मुख ् यतः विनियामक ढाँचे के बाहर काम करते हैं । पैबंद वाली इन प ् रणालियों के लाभ भी हैं । उदाहरण के लिए , बांग ् लादेश में एक ताज ़ ा अध . ययन में निष ् कर ् ष निकाला गया है कि अक ् सर बाज ़ ार के स ् टालों से संचालन करने वाले तथाकथित &quot; गाँव के डॉक ् टरों &quot; द ् वारा प to रदान की जाने वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं ने प ् रसवोत ् तर रोगाणुता और बचपन के निमोनिया से मृत ् यु दर में गिरावट लाने में योगदान किया है । लेकिन इसके भी काफ ़ ी सबूत हैं कि प ् रदान की जा रही दवाएँ विविध गुणवत ् ता की होती हैं और अक ् सर उन ् हें बिना आवश ् यकता के ले लिया जाता है । बहुत बार , रोगी इलाज का पूरा कोर ् स नहीं ख ़ रीदते ।
इस पर एक प ् रतिक ् रिया यह हो सकती है कि ऐसे क ़ ानून तैयार और लागू किए जाएँ जिनसे एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ केवल डॉक . टर के पर ् चे पर उपलब ् ध हो सकें । बहरहाल , इसके परिणामस ् वरूप एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं तक ग ़ रीब लोगों की पहुँच गंभीर रूप से सीमित हो सकती है , जिससे संक ् रमण से मृत ् यु दर उच ् च हो सकती है , जो इसे राजनीतिक रूप से अस ् वीकार ् य और इसलिए लागू करने में मुश . किल बना देगा । इसका बेहतर विकल ् प यह होगा कि एंटीबायोटिक इलाजों को बेहतर बनाने के लिए ऐसी नई रणनीतियाँ विकसित की जाएँ जिनसे इन ् हें अनौपचारिक स ् रोतों के माध ् यम से प ् रदान किया जाए ।
शुरूआत करनेवालों . लिए , उन दवाओं पर भरोसेमंद निगरानी डेटा उत ् पन ् न करने के लिए निवेश करने की ज ़ रूरत है जो आ � � संक ् रमण के ख ़ िलाफ ़ प ् रभावी हैं । इलाज के दिशा @-@ निर ् देशों में यह जानकारी शामिल की जानी चाहिए और एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के सभी प to रदाताओं की दी जानी चाहिए ।
इस बीच , उच ् च गुणवत ् ता वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ किफ ़ ायती क ़ ीमतों पर उपलब ् ध कराई जानी चाहिए । नकली उत ् पादों की पहचान की जानी चाहिए और उन ् हें बाज ़ ार से निकाल दिया जाना चाहिए , और गुणवत . ता नियंत ् रित करने के लिए सरकारों , फ ़ ार ् मास ् यूटिकल क ् षेत ् र , और नागरिक समूहों के बीच नियामक साझेदारी विकसित की जानी चाहिए । क ़ ीमतों को थोक ख ़ रीद के माध . यम से कम रखा जाना चाहिए ; कुछ मामलों में , सार ् वजनिक आर ् थिक सहायता भी ज ़ रूरी हो सकती है ।
क ़ ीमतों को कम करने के उपायों के पूरक के रूप में बहुत ज ़ ् यादा इस ् तेमाल को हतोत ् साहित करने की ज ़ रूरत होगी । पैकेजिंग में नवाचार , शायद दवाओं के उचित संयोजन का पूरा कोर ् स उपलब . ध कराना , इलाज के फ ़ ैसले को आसान बना सकेगा । इसी तरह , कम @-@ लागत की नैदानिक प to रौद ् योगिकियों का विकास केवल लक ् षणों के आधार पर इलाज प ् रदान करने की ज ़ रूरत कम करने में मदद कर सकता है ।
सबसे बड ़ ी चुनौती एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के प ् रदाताओं को अपना व ् यवहार बदलने . लिए प <pad> रोत ् साहित करना होगी । इसके लिए , तकनीकी सहायता देने और कार ् य @-@ निष ् पादन की निगरानी के लिए मान ् यता , भुगतान तंत ् र के संशोधन , और मध ् यस ् थ संगठनों की भागीदारी जैसे उपायों की ज ़ रूरत होगी । इन संगठनों में गैर @-@ सरकारी संगठन , धार ् मिक संगठन , सामाजिक उद ् यमी , और दवाएँ वितरित करने वाली कंपनियाँ शामिल हो सकती हैं । इसकी संभावना नहीं है कि ये गतिविधियाँ वाणिज ् यिक रूप से स ् थायी हो सकेंगी , और इसलिए इनके लिए सरकारों , परोपकारी संस . थाओं , और शायद दवा उत ् पादकों से समर ् थन की ज ़ रूरत होगी ।
इस बीच , लोगों को एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के समुचित इस ् तेमाल पर भरोसेमंद जानकारी और सलाह मिलनी चाहिए । यह ख ़ ास तौर से वहाँ महत . वपूर ् ण है जहाँ नागरिक स ् वास ् थ <pad> य की समस ् याओं से निपटने के लिए काफ ़ ी हद तक अपने खुद के संसाधनों पर निर ् भर करते हैं ।
एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के इस ् तेमाल में प ् रणाली में व ् यापक बदलाव लागू करने के लिए राष <pad> ट ् रीय और वैश ् विक गठबंधनों की ज ़ रूरत होगी । एक मुख ् य लक ् ष ् य स ् वास ् थ ् य कर ् मियों और दवा कंपनियों . आचरण के बुनियादी मानक स ् थापित करना होगा जिसमें रोगियों और समुदायों की ज ़ रूरतें प ् रतिबिंबित हों । सरकारों को इस प ् रक ् रिया में प ् रभावी भूमिका निभाने के लिए अपनी क ् षमता का निर ् माण करने की ज ़ रूरत होगी , और दवाओं और नैदानिक प ् रौद ् योगिकियों का विकास , उत ् पादन , और वितरण करने वाली कंपनियों को सहयोगी समाधानों की खोज के लिए सक . रिय रूप से योगदान करना होगा । हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं से सही रूप में लाभ तभी उठा सकेंगे जब हम उनका निष ् पक ् ष और स ् थायी तरीके से प ् रबंधन कर सकेंगे ।
डावोस - 1980 के दशक के मध ् य में जब मैं एक मेडिकल छात ् र था , मुझे पापुआ न ् यू गिनी में मलेरिया हुआ था । यह एक कष ् टकारी अनुभव था । मेरे सिर में दर ् द होता था । मेरा तापमान बढ ़ गया था । मुझमें खून की कमी हो गई थी । लेकिन मैंने दवा लेना जारी रखा , और मैं ठीक हो गया । यह अनुभव सुखद नहीं था , लेकिन सस ् ती , प ् रभावशाली मलेरिया की दवाओं की बदौलत मैं बहुत ज . यादा खतरे में कभी नहीं था ।
क ् लोरोक ् विन की जिन गोलियों से मैं ठीक हुआ था वे गोलियां अब बिल ् कुल काम नहीं करती हैं । यहां तक कि जब मैं उन ् हें ले रहा था तब भी , जिस परजीवी के कारण मलेरिया होता है वह पहले ही दुनिया के कई हिस ् सों में क ् लोरोक . विन का प ् रतिरोधी बन चुका था ; पापुआ न . यू गिनी उन कुछ स ् थानों में से एक था जहां गोलियाँ प ् रभावशाली बनी हुई थीं , और इसके बावजूद वहां भी उनकी शक ् ति कम होती जा रही थी । आज , क ् लोरोक ् विन मूल रूप से हमारे चिकित ् सा शस ् त ् रागार से गायब हो गई है ।
एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं और अन ् य रोगाणुरोधी दवाओं का प ् रतिरोध करनेवाले रोगाणुओं की बढ ़ ती क ् षमता आजकल के स ् वास ् थ ् य देखभाल के क @-@ षेत ् र में सबसे बड ़ े उभरते संकट में तब . दील हो रही है - और यह एक ऐसा संकट है जिसे अकेले विज ् ञान द ् वारा हल नहीं किया जा सकता है ।
अब क ् लोरोक . विन की जगह अन ् य दवाएं आने लगी हैं । तपेदिक की बहु @-@ दवा @-@ प ् रतिरोधी प ् रजातियां , ई.कोली , और साल ् मोनेला अब आम हो चुकी हैं । अधिकांश सूजाक संक ् रमण लाइलाज हैं । मेथिसिलिन @-@ प ् रतिरोधी स ् टैफ ़ िलोकॉकस ऑरियस ( एसआरएसए ) और क ् लोस ् ट ् रीडियम डिफ ़ िसाइल जैसे सुपरबग , तेजी से फैल रहे हैं । भारत में एंटीबायोटिक @-@ प ् रतिरोधी संक . रमणों से 2013 में 58,000 से अधिक नवजात शिशुओं की मृत ् यु हो गई थी ।
आज , मलेरिया का इलाज अक ् सर चीनी जड ़ ी @-@ बूटी से निकाली गई एक दवा - आर . टीमिसिनिन - और अन . य मलेरिया @-@ रोधी दवाओं के संयोजन से किया जाता है । लेकिन इन क ् रांतिकारी दवाओं के क ् लोरोक ् विन की ही तरह अप ् रचलन में होने का खतरा है ; दक ् षिण पूर ् व एशिया में मलेरिया की प ् रतिरोधी @-@ प ् रजातियां होने का पता चला है ।
यह मात ् र चिकित ् सा समस ् या नहीं है ; यह एक संभावित आर ् थिक आपदा है । अर ् थशास ् त ् री जिम ओ नील की अध . यक ् षता में की गई रोगाणुरोधी प ् रतिरोध पर समीक ् षा द ् वारा की गई शोध में यह अनुमान लगाया गया है कि यदि मौजूदा प ् रवृत ् तियां जारी रहती हैं तो दवा प ् रतिरोधी संक ् रमणों से 2050 तक प ् रति वर ् ष दस लाख लोगों की मृत ् यु होगी और अगले 35 वर ् षों में वैश ् विक अर . थव ् यवस ् था को लगभग $ 100 ट ् रिलियन खर . च करना पड ़ ेगा ।
हो सकता है कि यह नाटकीय भविष ् यवाणी भी बहुत कम हो क @-@ योंकि इसमें संक ् रमण के कारण जीवन और स ् वास ् थ ् य की होने वाली हानि की दृष ् टि से केवल प ् रत . यक ् ष लागतें ही शामिल हैं । आधुनिक चिकित ् सा के कई अन ् य पहलू भी एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं पर भरोसा करते हैं । कीमोथेरेपी प ् राप ् त करनेवाले कैंसर रोगी इन ् हें बैक ् टीरिया को दबाने के लिए लेते हैं जो अन ् यथा उनकी कमजोर प ् रतिरक ् षा प ् रणाली पर हमला कर देगा । आजकल जोड ़ ों के प <pad> रतिस ् थापन और सीजेरियन वर ् गों सहित जिन शल ् यक ् रियाओं को नेमी मान लिया जाता है , उन ् हें केवल तभी सुरक ् षित � � � ूप से किया जा सकता है जब एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं से संभावित संक ् रमणों को रोका जाता है ।
दवा प ् रतिरोध के मूल विकास के अच ् छी तरह से समझे @-@ बूझे मामले हैं । यदि रोगजनकों पर विषाक ् त दवाओं का चयनात . मक दबाव पड ़ ता है , तो अंततः वे उसके अनुकूल हो जाएंगे । मैं जिस वैलकम ट <pad> रस ् ट का नेतृत ् व करता हूं , उसने इन तंत ् रों के बारे में शोध , निदान में सुधार , और नई दवाएं तैयार करने में करोड ़ ों डॉलर का निवेश किया है ।
समस ् या का प ् रभावी ढंग से समाधान करने <pad> लिए , इस प ् रयास को जैविक विज ् ञान के दायरे से आगे बढ ़ ाकर दवा के साथ पारंपरिक रूप से न जुड ़ े क ् षेत ् रों तक ले जाना चाहिए । अमीर और गरीब देशों दोनों में ही समान रूप से , हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के नियमित नशेड ़ ी बन गए हैं । प ् रतिरोध का मुकाबला करने की कुंजी यह है कि रोगजनक जिस गति से अनुकूलन कर सकते हैं उस गति को कम किया जाए । लेकिन , एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के अधिक उपयोग और उपचार के लिए आवश ् यक कोर ् स को पूरा न करने के फलस ् वरूप , हम रोगाणुओं का उपयोग अभी पर ् याप ् त दवा प ् रतिरोध को प ् रोत . साहित करने के लिए कर रहे हैं । वास ् तव में , हम रोगाणुओं का टीका लगाकर हम उनके खिलाफ जो प ् रयोग करना चाहते हैं उसे दवाओं . खिलाफ कर रहे हैं ।
यह इसलिए है कि हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं को लगभग उपभोक ् ता वस ् तुओं के रूप में मानने लग गए हैं , क ् योंकि हम डॉक ् टरों से इसकी मांग करते हैं , और हम इसे अपनी मर ् ज ़ ी से लेते हैं या जब हमें ठीक लगता है हम इसे लेना बंद कर देते हैं । यहां तक कि सबसे अधिक सूचनाप ् राप ् त रोगियों द . वारा इन चमत ् कारी दवाओं का दुरुपयोग किया जाता है । यूनाइटेड किंगडम में की गई शोध से पता चला है कि यहां तक कि जो लोग यह समझते हैं कि प ् रतिरोध कैसे विकसित होता है वे अक ् सर समस ् या को इस रूप में बढ ़ ा देते हैं कि वे डॉक ् टर के पर <pad> चे के बिना एंटीबायोटिक लेने लगते हैं या अपनी दवाएं अपने परिवार के सदस ् यों को दे देते हैं ।
ऐसे विनाशकारी व ् यवहार को बदलने . लिए यह आवश of यक होगा कि हम इसके सामाजिक और सांस ् कृतिक कारणों को बेहतर रूप से समझें । इतिहास , मनोविज ् ञान , समाजशास ् त ् र , नृविज ् ञान , अर ् थशास ् त ् र , बाजार अनुसंधान , और सामाजिक विपणन जैसे विषय इसमें मदद कर सकते हैं ।
यह केवल रोगाणुरोधी प ् रतिरोध . लिए ही सत ् य नहीं है । यह इबोला जैसी महामारी के फैलने पर भी लागू होता है । वायरस का मुकाबला करने के लिए उसके जीव विज ् ञान , इसके संचारण के महामारी विज . ञान , और उन दवाओं और टीकों के बारे में ज ् ञान की आवश ् यकता है जिनका संभवतः इसके खिलाफ उपयोग किया जा सकता है । लेकिन इसके लिए उन व ् यवहारों को भी समझने की आवश ् यकता है जिनके कारण यह संक ् रमण लाइबेरिया , सिएरा लियोन , और गिनी में फैल सका ।
यह समझाने के लिए कि ये समाज किन कारणों से इतने कमजोर बने हैं , इसके लिए इन क ् षेत ् रों के हाल के इतिहास के बारे में जानने और यह समझने की आवश ् यकता है कि वहां . लोगों में सरकारी अधिकारियों के प ् रति इतना अधिक अविश ् वास क ् यों है । इबोला को नियंत ् रण में रखने के लिए रोगियों को अलग रखना और मृतकों को सुरक ् षित रूप से दफन करना महत ् वपूर ् ण हैं , लेकिन दोनों को सांस ् कृतिक संवेदनशीलता के साथ लागू किए जाने की जरूरत है - केवल उनके पीछे मौजूद विज ् ञान संबंधी कारणों . स to पष ् टीकरण की नहीं ।
आज के सार ् वजनिक स ् वास ् थ ् य के बड ़ े खतरों के आर ् थिक परिणाम बहुत गंभीर होते हैं । उनके कारण होनेवाले जोखिमों को न ् यूनतम रखने के लिए यह जानना बहुत जरूरी है कि वे सामाजिक , व <pad> यवहार संबंधी और सांस ् कृतिक परिदृश ् य के साथ परस ् पर गुंथे हुए हैं । विज ् ञान शक ् तिशाली उपकरण उपलब . ध करता है । लेकिन इन उपकरणों का प ् रभावी रूप से उपयोग करने <pad> लिए हमें केवल विज ् ञान की ही जरूरत नहीं है ।
BRISBANE - The significance of the upcoming Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Beijing consists . so much in what is on APEC &apos;s agenda as in what transpires . the sidelines .
Meetings , Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama ; as well as Xi &apos;s meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe loom especially <pad> .
These bilateral relationships constitute much of the <pad> undercurrent of East Asian security . . time when the region &apos;s long @-@ term geostrategic stability has come into question .
The core reality is that the <pad> @-@ Pacific region comprises a group of rapidly globalizing twenty @-@ first @-@ century economies sitting on top of a set of nineteenth @-@ <pad> national tensions .
The contradiction matters for the entire world , because the <pad> accounts for some 60 % of global output .
Economically speaking , where Asia goes in the future , <pad> world will follow .
The Asia is home to a multiplicity of unresolved territorial disputes .
It is the epicenter of underlying tensions stemming . China &apos;s rise and its impact on the United States , the region , established power . World War II &apos;s end .
Indeed , many of the region &apos;s territorial disputes pit . against US allies .
More broadly , the region &apos;s rifts are endemic : <pad> divided Korean Peninsula ; territorial disputes between Russia and Japan , China and Korea , and <pad> and Japan ; , unique circumstances of Taiwan ; and conflicting maritime claims in the South China Sea involving China , the Philippines , Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia , Vietnam , and Taiwan .
There , also long @-@ standing border disputes between China and India , the between India and China &apos;s ally , Pakistan .
As the that <pad> not worrying enough , Asia has become the next global arms bazaar , with military outlays . the region now higher than in Europe .
Both the tone and the content of the China @-@ US relationship are a cause for concern .
China argues that it is subject to the US policy of isolation and containment .
It points . America &apos;s &quot; rebalancing &quot; strategy , to military and / or diplomatic support . those countries with which China has bilateral territorial disputes , and US support for Japan &apos;s revision of its post @-@ WWII &quot; <pad> constitution &quot; as a precursor for what China views as significant Japanese rearmament .
The Chinese also see the commercial equivalent @-@ containment in the US @-@ proposed Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership , which includes Japan , excludes China .
Furthermore , Chinese leaders . to what they regards as intrusive US human @-@ rights diplomacy aimed at fomenting political protest within China ( including Hong Kong ) and undermining the regime . domestic legitimacy .
The US , the surprise , disputes these claims .
For starters , the US argues that the is the various states of East Asia , have actively sought American support for their <pad> , owing to their collective concerns about China .
Moreover , the US insists that it is not containing China ( as it did the Soviet Union ) ; on the contrary , China &apos;s economic rise has been facilitated by the to US markets , as well as to global markets through American support . Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization .
On human rights , the US argues that there are indeed fundamental differences between the <pad> countries &quot; political traditions and current systems .
But , in the American view , this is vastly different from an organized national strategy . undermining the Chinese state and its institutions .
For these reasons , the bilateral strategic @-@ trust deficit is <pad> .
Xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as a concept for &quot; a new type of great power relationship , &quot; one that seeks to avoid what , have concluded is the near @-@ inevitability of the @-@ term conflict between the rising power ( China ) and the established power ( America ) .
It is imperative that both parties try to close the trust . .
Doing so calls for a framework of what <pad> call &quot; constructive realism . &quot;
Such a framework embraces realism about areas of contention defined by significant conflicting national <pad> and values .
These issues should simply be peacefully managed over time , until sufficient political <pad> has been created in the rest of the relationship to address the directly .
At the same time , it , &quot; constructive &quot; in the sense of identifying areas of sufficient commonality to create new public goods , such as bilateral investment treaties , a non @-@ nuclear Korean Peninsula , and a global agreement on the change .
A constructive realist approach should also begin to sketch <pad> broad outlines of a <pad> @-@ term &quot; common security &quot; concept for East Asia .
The outlook . the China @-@ Japan relationship appears somewhat better .
Just a few months ago , the bilateral relationship had sunk to an all @-@ time . @-@ war low , owing to a toxic cocktail of territorial disputes over the Diaoyu / Senkaku Islands , Japan , handling . its wartime history ( particularly prime ministerial visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine ) , and Chinese fears about Japanese rearmament .
But now to governments appear to have recognized the growing risk of unintended conflict in the seas and airspace around the disputed territories , given the sheer concentration of naval and air assets , a limited space . the absence of effective protocols to manage incidents and prevent them from escalating .
Both sides have concluded that even limited armed conflict , be disastrous .
Moreover , the Japan and China facing increasing economic uncertainty , they been recognized that it makes sense for the world &apos;s second and third largest economies to remove major political impediments to expanded bilateral trade @-@ investment .
For these reasons , barring any last @-@ minute diplomatic indelicacies , the APEC Summit , likely to represent <pad> start of a formal thaw in Sino @-@ Japanese relations .
APEC , an Australian diplomatic initiative launched 25 years . , was originally conceived as an exclusively economic forum .
Fortunately , it has also become <pad> annual forum for the , Chinese , Japanese , and other <pad> to engage with one another on critical questions of long @-@ term strategic stability .
The future of the region , economy and the <pad> economy - and the stability upon which , are predicated - will be powerfully shaped by the outcome of these deliberations .
Appeal for freedom of speech and respect . minority rights in Russia
We to taken aback and dismayed by reports of actions directed against ethnic Georgians in Russia .
These include accounts . the international media that Moscow police have asked schools to draw up lists of pupils with Georgian surnames as part of the search for illegal immigrants , and verifiable cases where Georgian businesses in Russia have to closed .
Knowing the importance to poor families of remittance to Georgia , we are <pad> concerned at reports of measures , block bank transfers .
We feel obliged to emphasize that disputes between governments are not grounds for actions against the civilian population .
We would hope that the leadership . the Russian Federation will affirm <pad> rights of ethnic minorities ; refrain from hostile rhetoric and actions against Georgians ; and ensure that our common democratic values and respectful relations between neighbours are upheld .
I vividly remember the slightly ludicrous , slightly risqué , the somewhat distressing predicament in which Western diplomats in Prague found themselves during the Cold War .
They regularly needed to resolve the delicate issue , whether to invite to their embassy celebrations various Charter 77 signatories , human rights activists , critics of the communist regime , displaced politicians , the even banned writers , scholars , the journalists - people with whom the diplomats were generally friends .
Sometimes we dissidents were not invited , but received an apology , <pad> sometimes we were invited , but did not accept the invitation so <pad> not to complicate the lives of our courageous diplomat friends .
Or we were invited to the at an earlier hour in the hope that we would leave before the official representatives arrived , which sometimes worked , sometimes didn &apos;t .
When it didn &apos;t , either the official representatives left <pad> protest at our presence , or we left hurriedly , or we all pretended not to notice each other , or - albeit on rare occasions - we started to converse with each other , which frequently were the only moments of dialogue between the regime and <pad> opposition ( the counting our courthouse encounters ) .
The all happened when the Iron Curtain divided Europe - and the world - into opposing camps .
The diplomats had their countries &quot; economic interests to consider , but , unlike the Soviet side , they took seriously the idea of &quot; dissidents or <pad> . &quot;
I cannot recall the occasion at the time when the West or any <pad> its organizations ( NATO , the European Community , etc . ) issued some public appeal , recommendation , or edict stating that some specific group of independently @-@ minded people - however defined - were not to be invited to diplomatic parties , celebrations , or receptions .
One of the strongest and most powerful democratic institutions in the world - the European Union - has no qualms in making a public promise of . Cuban dictatorship that it will re @-@ institute diplomatic Apartheid .
The EU &apos;s embassies in Havana will now craft their guest lists in accordance . . Cuban government &apos;s wishes .
The shortsightedness of socialist Prime Minister José Zapatero of Spain , prevailed .
Try to imagine what will happen : at the European embassy , someone will be appointed to screen the list , name by name , and assess <pad> and <pad> what extent the persons in question behave freely or speak out freely in public , to what extent they criticize the regime , or even whether they are former political prisoners .
Lists will be shortened and deletions made , and <pad> will frequently entail eliminating even good personal friends of the diplomats in charge . the screening , people whom they have given various forms of intellectual , political , or material assistance .
It will be even worse if the <pad> countries try to mask their screening activities by inviting only diplomats to embassy celebrations in Cuba .
I can hardly think of a better way for the EU to dishonor the noble ideals of freedom , equality , the human rights . the Union espouses - indeed , principles that the reiterates in its constitutional agreement .
To protect European corporations &quot; profits from their Havana hotels , the Union will cease inviting open @-@ minded people to EU embassies , and <pad> will deduce who they been from the expression on the face of the dictator and his associates .
It is hard to imagine a <pad> shameful deal .
Cuba , dissidents will , of course , happily do without Western cocktail parties and polite conversation at receptions .
This persecution will admittedly aggravate . difficult struggle , but they will naturally survive it .
The question is whether the EU will survive it .
Today , the EU is dancing to Fidel &apos;s tune .
That means that tomorrow it . bid for contracts to build missile bases of the coast of the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The following day it could allow its decisions on Chechnya . be dictated by Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s advisers .
Then , for some unknown reason , it could make its assistance to Africa conditional . fraternal ties with the worst of dictators .
Denying , visa to Russian human rights activist Sergey Kovalyov ?
It is suicidal for the EU to draw on Europe &apos;s worst political traditions , the common denominator of which is the idea that evil must be appeased and that the best way to achieve peace is through indifference to the freedom of others .
Just the opposite is true : <pad> policies expose an indifference to one &apos;s own freedom . pave the way for war .
After all , Europe </s> uniting in order to defend its freedom and values , not to sacrifice them to the ideal of harmonious coexistence with dictators and thus to gradual infiltration of its soul by the anti @-@ democratic mindset .
I firmly to that the new members of the <pad> will not forget their experience of totalitarianism and non @-@ violent opposition to evil , and that that experience will be reflected in how they behave in the bodies .
Indeed , this could be the best contribution they can make to the common spiritual , moral , and <pad> foundations of a united Europe .
This month , been a bad one for the cause of human <pad> in Europe , as Serbia was allowed to begin its six @-@ month presidency of the <pad> of Europe , the Continent &apos;s oldest political body .
With Serbia at the helm , the Council , which aims to promote human rights . . rule of law , is now overseen by a <pad> that thumbs its nose at the Genocide Convention and harbors an indicted war crimes suspect , former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic .
Moreover , the European Commission has indicated that it is ready to resume talks aimed at bringing Serbia closer to the European Union as soon as a <pad> @-@ oriented government . formed in Belgrade .
Earlier the year , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) found Serbia guilty of failing to prevent the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men . Srebrenica .
The Court also declared that Serbia will remain in violation of the Genocide Convention until it transfers Mladic - who is believed responsible for some of the worst crimes in Europe since the Second of War - to be International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) in The Hague .
But the EU of ready to ignore Serbia &apos;s disdain for international law .
The EU is understandably eager to support a pro @-@ European government in Serbia , for this might pave the <pad> for Serbia , swallow the prospect of Kosovo &apos;s independence .
That explains why some EU . states are keen to resume the negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement , which were suspended a year ago due to Serbia &apos;s failure to cooperate fully <pad> . ICTY .
The proposed u @-@ turn by the EU means that Mladic &apos;s arrest and transfer to The Hague is no longer <pad> condition for restarting talks .
Of course , Europe needs to sweeten the Kosovo , for Serbia .
But an immediate resumption of negotiations amounts to an <pad> that is all carrot and <pad> stick , damaging the EU &apos;s own credibility .
Indeed , the West . already tried this approach before , with paltry results .
The December 2006 , NATO allowed Serbia to join its Partnership for Peace , even though there were still war criminals at the in the country .
This softer approach , prove counterproductive , as it will not strengthen democratic forces in Serbia .
Just last week , caretaker Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , once hailed . Europe as a great democrat , showed his true colors .
He went so far as the support the election of an extreme nationalist , Tomislav Nikolic , who was an old ally . Milosevic &apos;s , as the Speaker of the Serbian Parliament .
The head of Nikolic . party , Vojislav Seselj , the in the dock in The Hague facing trial for war crimes .
Although Nikolic soon resigned after a new Serbian government . formed , the cabinet &apos;s composition suggests that the EU might be foolish to expect greater cooperation with the ICTY .
By effectively abandoning conditionality , the EU will be rewarding . most intransigent hard @-@ liners in Serbia - that is , the very people . have opposed the arrest of Mladic for years .
The the ICTY &apos;s closure just one year away , there is a risk of Mladic will never be held accountable .
The effect that the resumption of talks might have on the system of international <pad> is no less chilling .
Serbia </s> leadership of the Council of Europe is a done deal .
But the EU must insist on Serbia &apos;s compliance with the ICTY , <pad> ICJ decision , the its own Copenhagen political criteria .
Mladic must be arrested . talks start , not after .
As the signal , their seriousness , European governments should think twice before they accept Serbia &apos;s invitation to attend the Council of Europe &apos;s festive 1,000th meeting in June .
A minute of silence for the victims of unarrested war criminals might be a more appropriate way . pay tribute to the Council &apos;s core values of human rights and justice than attending the <pad> now being planned in Belgrade .
BERLIN - The world &apos;s task in addressing North Korea &apos;s saber rattling . made no easier to the fact that it confronts an impoverished and effectively defeated country .
On the contrary , it is in such circumstances that calm foresight . most necessary .
The genius of the Habsburg Empire &apos;s Prince Klemens von Metternich in framing a new international order after the Napoleonic Wars was <pad> he did not push a defeated France into a corner .
Although Metternich sought to deter any possible French resurgence , he restored France , prewar frontiers .
By contrast , as Henry Kissinger has argued , the victors in World War , could neither deter a defeated Germany nor provide it with incentives , accept the Versailles Treaty .
Instead , the imposed harsh terms , hoping to weaken Germany permanently .
During the Cuban missile crisis , he did not try to humiliate . win a total victory over the Soviet Union .
Rather , he put himself in Nikita Khrushchev . shoes and agreed to dismantle , secretly , American missiles in Turkey and Italy in exchange for withdrawal of Soviet missiles . Cuba .
Sadly , North Korea has not received the far @-@ sighted statesmanship .
Faced with the North &apos;s dangerous nuclear game , we should ask what would have happened if , over <pad> last 20 some @-@ , the North Korea , had been approached with the sagacity of Metternich and Kennedy .
Of course , North Korea is <pad> early @-@ nineteenth century France or the USSR of 1962 .
In the eyes of the ( including Japanese ) political leaders , it has never amounted to more than a small , fringe country whose economic failings made it appear to be poised perpetually on the edge of self @-@ destruction .
For the most <pad> , world , preferred not to be bothered with North Korea , and so reacted in an ad hoc way whenever it created a security problem .
But now , following the North &apos;s <pad> nuclear tests , and <pad> its improving ballistic @-@ missile capabilities , that approach is no longer tenable .
Perhaps the best chance to address the problem at the earlier stage . immediately after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 .
Back then , Kim Il @-@ sung - the North &apos;s founder - faced economic collapse , diminution . his conventional military forces , and diplomatic isolation .
In interviews with Asahi Shimbun and The Washington Times in March <pad> April 1992 , Kim clearly expressed a wish to establish diplomatic relations with the <pad> .
But US and South Korean <pad> were not ready to accommodate Kim &apos;s overture .
Their received ideas about the Korea prevented them from recognizing a fast @-@ changing political reality .
If North Korea had reciprocated in the timely manner following US envoy William Perry &apos;s visit to Pyongyang in May 1999 , President Bill Clinton &apos;s policy of engagement with the North might have been upgraded . a push for normalization . diplomatic relations .
Instead , the North procrastinated , sending Vice Marshall Jo Myong @-@ rok of the US only in October 2000 , near the end of Clinton &apos;s presidency .
A few months later , newly elected President George W. the reversed Clinton &apos;s North Korea policy .
The still recall the difficulty that I faced , as South Korea &apos;s foreign minister , <pad> convincing Bush administration policymakers to negotiate with North Korea instead of merely applying pressure and waiting for the North to capitulate .
Back then , North Korea was restarting its Yongbyon nuclear facility and producing plutonium , thus strengthening its bargaining position vis @-@ à @-@ vis the <pad> .
Precious time was squandered . North Korea &apos;s first nuclear test in 2006 .
Though Bush shifted his policy toward bilateral negotiations with the North a few months later , the Kim regime had to much more obstinate .
Indeed , North Korea , behavior has since become even more volatile .
Its sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan . the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island . 2010 were unprecedented , and raised inter @-@ Korean tensions to their highest level in decades .
Today , following the North &apos;s third nuclear test , we seem to have entered the most precarious stage yet , with the regime declaring that it will never surrender its nuclear option .
The first option should be deterrence of the aggression through diplomacy .
The achieving diplomatic deterrence will depend on China &apos;s cooperation , the this requires that China &apos;s vital national @-@ security interests be recognized .
China fears not only the social and economic consequences of a North Korean implosion , but also the strategic consequences of reunification - in particular , that the US of , through the alliance with South Korea , would gain access to territory <pad> its border .
A mere statement by the US of it has no intention to press the military advantage will not assuage China &apos;s fears .
The leaders recall that the US promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , German reunification and democratic transition in Eastern Europe would not mean eastward expansion of NATO .
The a more concrete undertaking , one that preserves South Korea &apos;s bedrock security concerns , is needed .
Only after its security is assured will China free itself from complicity in North Korean brinkmanship . be better able to control the North <pad> behavior . &amp; # 160 ;
But Chinese cooperation , though necessary , <pad> not resolve the North Korea problem , its own .
A comprehensive approach , recognize the speed of internal change , especially in the minds of ordinary North Koreans .
Simply put , North Koreans are not as isolated as the once were , the have a growing appreciation of their impoverishment , owing primarily to greater trade @-@ closer connections with booming China .
This internal change needs to be encouraged , because the will prove <pad> effective than external pressure in influencing the regime &apos;s behavior .
The such encouragement must be undertaken in ways that do not incite the North &apos;s fears of being destroyed by indirect means . &amp; # 160 ; South Korean <pad> Park Geun @-@ hye &apos;s recent proposal to provide humanitarian assistance despite the recent spike in tension , is a start in the <pad> direction .
The lives . ordinary <pad> Koreans matter as much as the security of North Korea &apos;s neighbors .
A comprehensive approach is required - one that focuses . much on the human dimension as on the <pad> dimension .
It remains to be seen . this <pad> requires more foresight and courage than today &apos;s political leaders in South Korea , the West , and China can muster .
The deaths of Yasir Arafat and of Sheikh Zayd , the long @-@ standing ruler , the United Arab Emirates , continues the generational change that began in 1999 @-@ 2000 , when the leaders of Jordan , Morocco , Bahrain , and Syria died . quick succession .
Across the Middle East people are younger , and <pad> political leaders older , the the world average .
The gradual replacement . . generation of elites by another may be one of the key factors in determining whether or not effective <pad> takes place in the Arab world .
At present , four political generations co @-@ exist . the region &apos;s socio @-@ political map .
The outgoing leadership generation - that of Arafat , King Hussein , Hafiz al @-@ Assad , King Fahd and President Mubarak - was born before 1935 and has determined events in the <pad> East since the 1970 &quot; s .
The leaders came of age and began their careers during the era of decolonization .
They been weaned on Gamal Abdel @-@ Nasser &apos;s pan @-@ Arab nationalism , and the crucial political event for them was the <pad> defeat in the 1967 Arab @-@ Israeli war .
Members of this generation sought a <pad> Arab leadership that <pad> create a balance of power with Israel .
The also believed in - or at least toyed with - forms of socialism , étatism , and did not consider democracy or civil rights to be priorities .
The <pad> generation was born between 1935 and 1955 , and in many respects represents a generation &quot; . between . &quot;
Most benefited . the economic growth and expanded educational opportunities associated with the oil boom , the 1970 &quot; s .
At the <pad> time , political participation remained blocked by the previous generation , which , intended to give up power voluntarily .
Unsurprisingly , many in this generation grew dissatisfied , the not a few began to look <pad> Islamic alternatives to the prevailing political systems .
Rather than determining events in the coming two or three decades , this generation is likely to be sidelined by the next cohort , born between 1955 . 1975 .
This . the generation of Syria &apos;s President Bashar al @-@ Assad , Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah and Morocco &apos;s King Muhammad VI . Some call this the &quot; generation of sons &quot; - sons of leaders who led their states for decades .
This age cohort was not much influenced by the Arab @-@ Israeli wars . the East @-@ West conflict . Instead , their <pad> education included the Gulf War of 1991 and the Arab @-@ Israeli peace process of the 1990 &quot; s , with its crises and breakdown .
Jailed West Bank Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti is as representative of this group of . leaders of Syria and Jordan .
Members of this generation are <pad> acquainted with notions of globalization and economic reform than with socialism , revolution .
Except for the Palestinians , they have never known their countries other than the independent and comparatively stable states .
In the Palestinian territories , the jil al @-@ intifada , the generation of the ( first and second ) Palestinian uprising , will be <pad> the founding generation .
But it is the fourth group that underscores the relevance of generational issues in the . world .
The when combined , the first three generations make up barely one @-@ third @-@ the entire Arab population .
Almost 60 % of all Arabs . younger than 20 , with roughly 70 % below the age of 30 .
This raises a key question : what happens to these Arab &quot; baby boomers &quot; . the generation now coming to power clings to it the tenaciously as the generation of Mubarak , Assad , and Hussein ?
The political generation of Bashar al @-@ Assad , King Abdullah , and Gamal Mubarak - son . Egypt &apos;s ailing president - forms a less coherent picture of that of the outgoing leadership .
In that elder generation , the had pursued military careers , and many of the aides and collaborators were engineers and civil servants .
The socio @-@ professional profile . the new elite is broader .
Economists , bankers , and entrepreneurs as well as of technology . communication experts are common .
There are <pad> . traditional politicians : personalities who see themselves as representatives of particular social or economic interests , not as apolitical technocrats .
This . leadership elite is in many ways , cosmopolitan than its predecessors ; their average level of education is higher ; a few have foreign degrees .
Developments , Morocco , Bahrain , and Jordan certainly seem to suggest that this changing of the guard can help soften rigid political structures and allow for broader participation .
But generational change need to be accompanied by economic <pad> and steps towards political liberalization - witness North Korea under Kim Il Sung &apos;s son , Kim Jong Il .
Indeed , experience gives little reason , presume that a modern way . speaking , willingness to liberalize the economy , and an urge for technological development automatically translates into a democratic opening .
It , more realistic to expect <pad> the new Arab elites will make use of their <pad> &quot; authoritarian institutions , both to overcome resistance to their economic agendas and to consolidate their newly acquired power .
The is anything but a risk @-@ free path .
Without a significant increase in opportunities for the participation , including genuinely competitive elections , the chasm between a predominantly young population and a ruling elite with the narrow generational base will widen .
Such continuing political inertia leaves an <pad> young Arab population prey to the appeal of extremist ideologies , while driving the best and brightest to seek to fortune elsewhere .
The problem , succession in the Arab secular republics highlights their predicament in the transition to a post @-@ revolutionary phase , <pad> succession in regimes that fail to build strong institutions always risks triggering a systemic crisis .
The the decision by some in favor of dynastic succession may be lacking in the , it is not entirely devoid of merit .
Arguably , it is a choice for economic modernization , the an end to the politics of conflict , and for positive political change further down the road .
Years of Western @-@ backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of the liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes , and turned any abrupt move to free elections into <pad> dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy .
A democracy that produces governments led to Hamas , Hezbollah , or the Muslim Brotherhood is inevitably bound to be anti @-@ Western and opposed to an American @-@ inspired &quot; . process &quot; with the .
Syria has already sought to assure <pad> continuity through quasi @-@ monarchic hereditary succession with the move from Hafez al @-@ Assad to his son Bashar .
There are indications that Egypt might follow suit , the Hosni Mubarak &apos;s son , Gamal , taking over .
Likewise , Libya &apos;s Muammar Khaddafi may be succeeded by his son , Seif el Islam .
As products of revolutionary military takeovers , these secular nationalist regimes failed to produce genuine popular legitimacy . have had to fall . on the dynastic succession practiced by the regimes they toppled .
The centrality of hereditary succession in the quest for peace and stability was shown by Hafez al @-@ Assad when he agreed to unprecedented <pad> will gestures aimed at drawing Ehud Barak . Israeli government into a peace deal .
An old and sick man who was to die a few months later , he acted with a sense of urgency to reach the deal that would relieve his inexperienced son of the burden of struggling . the <pad> of the Golan Heights .
Bashar Assad remains essentially loyal to the father &apos;s legacy .
