experiment directory cotain all the model and experimental scripts that we use for experiments.

For both uni-direction and bi-direction models, we set RNN as defaut.

If you would like to use other model, in model.py, "rnn_type" argument need to be changed (Like GRU or LSTM) in *LM.__init__().

train_uni.sh is for uni-direction LM training

train_bi.sh is for bi-direction LM training

decode.sh is for decoding. Usage: decode.sh MODEL_FILE1 MODEL_FILE2 ... Giving decode.sh multiple arguments can perform model ensemble
